         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

HIS GRACE,
The DUKE of

His Majeſty's Armies, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHAT my Worthy Friend did,
when he publiſh'd one of my
precedent <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> I beg leave
now to do my ſelf, and to make uſe of the
Opportunity which my Preſence in <hi>England</hi>
at this time affords me, to preſent theſe Sheets
to YOUR GRACE. The End my Friend
had in that Dedication, was to procure me
the Protection of YOUR GRACE, to
whom it was then my Misfortune to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known:
But now I am ſo ſenſible of YOUR
<pb facs="tcp:56660:3"/>
GRACE's unmerited Favours, that this ſmall
Offering proceeds from Gratitude; tho' com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prudence were enough to have induc'd
me to ſhelter this Work under the Patronage
of a Name known and valued by all <hi>Europe;</hi>
a Name worthily born by YOUR GRACE,
the deſerved Heir of a Race of Heroes. That
Great and Warlike Spirit, which YOUR
GRACE inherits from a long Deſcent of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd
Anceſtors, takes You from that ſoft
Reſt and Eaſe You might enjoy at home,
and carries You abroad into the Field of
Fame and Glory, there to hazard both Life
and Fortune; the one for the Safety, the
other for the Honour and Reputation of
<hi>England:</hi> And 'tis That attracts the Hearts
of all Nations, even of our Enemies, and
inclines them to love, admire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
You; witneſs what we ſaw in that
Great Day of <hi>Landen,</hi> wherein Your Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
Courage vanquiſh'd our Victorious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
even then when you fell into their
Hands, dy'd in Your Noble Blood. Your
Valour amaz'd them, but Your Civil Generous
Deportment charm'd them, and has made the
Celebrated Name of ORMOND Reverenc'd
<pb facs="tcp:56660:3"/>
and Eſteem'd among all the High Officers of
the Armies of <hi>France;</hi> if I may not ſay
Fear'd, without diſreſpect to a Brave and
Valiant Enemy. They are great Judges of
Martial Worth and Merit; and therefore, at
the ſame time that they applaud and admire
it in YOUR GRACE, they cannot but be
apprehen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ive of it in an Enemy; eſpecially
when they conſider it lodg'd in One born
to Command, and whom the Greateſt
Monarch and General now in the World
has tutor'd through all the Steps and Degrees
of Experience, before he made him Lieutenant-General
of his Armies; tho' it were a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
antecedently due to ſo Illuſtrious a Perſon.
His Majeſty would have YOUR GRACE to
be the chief Sharer with him in all the Toils
and Dangers, to which he has ſo undauntedly
expos'd himſelf for the Common Good of the
Cauſe he heads: 'Twas You He would have
daily with him in the Trenches during the
moſt Famous and Important Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi>
to give YOUR GRACE all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of the Beſt and the moſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Knowledge in the ſeveral Arts of War,
that He may one Day confide the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:56660:4"/>
of his Armies to the DUKE of
ORMOND.</p>
            <p>But, MY LORD, I forget that I venture
upon an Attempt in which the ableſt Pens
may miſcarry. YOUR GRACE has been
ſo often regal'd with <hi>Epiſtles Dedicatory</hi> from
the moſt Ingenious Perſons, who look upon
You as the great Patron of <hi>Mars</hi> and of the
<hi>Muſes,</hi> that even at the beſt I can but make
an <hi>Eccho</hi> to their Endeavours, in ſetting forth
YOUR GRACE's due Praiſe. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
bids me be ſilent, and only deſire

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>SOme People will wonder why this Account comes out ſo late;
I rather complain that it comes out too ſoon. As late as
'tis publiſh'd, the Reader may eaſily perceive, by the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the Style, and the many Faults of the Preſs, that it
hath been both writ and printed in haſt. The great variety of
Action in the Laſt Campagne has ſwell'd this Hiſtory to a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
bulk, which therefore has requir'd ſome time to compoſe,
as well as to print. The Bookſellers to make the more haſt,
have put it into ſeveral Hands to have it printed, which is the
reaſon of the difference found in the ſpelling of ſeveral Words, beſides
other Faults, which I hope the Courteous Reader will pardon. I
have only corrected thoſe Errors of the Preſs which alter'd the
ſenſe of the Phraſe, the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t I muſt leave to be amended by the
Judicious Reader.</p>
            <p>Indeed an Account of this nature ſhould not be publiſh'd without
being first perus'd by ſome of the General Officers concern'd: But
ſuch a just and neceſſary Circumſpection would keep the Work too long
from the Publick, which loves to have things New; therefore
it must e'en be content to have it attended with ſeveral Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
and (I may ſay) worſe Faults: 'Tis what obliges me to
beg the Excuſe of thoſe Great and Worthy Gentlemen, whoſe noble
Feats and Actions make up the ſubject of this History, for the
ſeveral Faults and mistakes of this Book; which if more exact,
would be more just to their deſerv'd Honour and Praiſe. In
ſo glorious an Action as the Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> where every Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concern'd has perform'd Wonders, it was very difficult for
me to do expreſs Justice to all; and therefore I hope, that when I
offend in this reſpect, their generous Nature will incline them to
Pardon.</p>
            <p>A dry Journal may be made in the Camp, but I think that an
Hiſtorical Account, wherein a Man must ſpecifie the Connexion
<pb facs="tcp:56660:5"/>
and Coherences of the ſeveral Matters of Fact, their relation to,
and dependance from one another, requires the Calm and Leiſure of
a Winter-Quarter to compoſe it.</p>
            <p>I have lately receiv'd from <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> the Plan of the Siege of
<hi>Namur,</hi> and of the Lines of Circumvallation, (done by an ingenious
Hand) with ſeveral other Particulars relating to the Siege, which
are come too late to be inſerted in my Book; but I have added at the
end of it as much as I could, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the Liſt of the <hi>Heſſe</hi> and <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh</hi>
Forces, and of thoſe encamp'd in the Line of Circumvallation.
As for the Plan, my Undertakings meet with ſo little Encouragement
that the Bookſellers could not go to the Charge of having it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grav'd,
and join'd to this Hiſtory. I have given it to Mr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
at the <hi>Atlas</hi> in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> where the Curious may have
it to explain and illuſtrate my Account of this Great and
Famous Siege. Such Diſcouragements may convince the World,
that I do not write for Profit. My End and Deſign is to ſatisfie
the Curioſity of <hi>Engliſh Men,</hi> ſo much concern'd in the Intereſt
and Charges of this War, and as much as lies in my Power to
give them a true Relation of Things. If I had not more regard
to the Satisfaction of my Country, than I have to my Labour and
Expences, I ſhould never concern my ſelf with theſe Matters.
Five Campagnes to One that ſhould affect a ſtudious and quiet
Life, is enough to put him out of conceit with War, or giving
an Account of it.</p>
            <closer>God continue the Succeſs of His Majeſty's Arms,
that our Enemies may be ſoon reduc'd to ſuch Juſt
and Reaſonable Terms, as may produce a ſpeedy and

Laſt Campagne

1695.</head>
            <p>THE Iſſue of the laſt Year's Campagne left the Scale
of War beginning to incline favourably on our ſide;
for though the Enemies at firſt ſeem'd to command
the Field, and that their Army domineer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

very Gates of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> yet at laſt they had much
ado to cover the Conquer'd <hi>Flanders</hi> from an Invaſion, and were
forced to leave <hi>Huy</hi> open to a Siege, and ſuffer it quietly to fall
in our hands, when it was ſo convenient a Poſt for <hi>Liege,</hi> and an

Out-work not only neceſſary for its ſafety, but that likewiſe gave
us the liberty of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> to the very Gates of <hi>Namur,</hi> to form
an attempt on that ſide when ever we ſhould have the Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Field; therefore whatever the Enemies may have
boaſted of their precipitate Marches the laſt year to cover their
Towns in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to maintain their Frontier at <hi>Courtray,</hi>
yet what we did then, open'd the way to the Great and Glorious
Undertaking of this happy and ſucceſsful Campagne.</p>
            <p>This would be a very ſtrange and ſurprizing turn to a Man

This variety of Events in the Affairs of War ought to
teach us, at the expence of our Enemies, not to be arrogant nor
inſulting in Succeſs, but ſtill to be thankful to God, to keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bounds of Moderation, and not to ſuffer our ſelves, to
be tranſported to ſuch Extravagancies which now upon this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
turn of the Scale of War, render the flattering and inſolent
Writings of our Enemies ridiculous to the meaner and the moſt
ordinary Reader.</p>
            <p>If the Counſels of our Enemies during the precedent Winter-Quarters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
were ſtill contriving ſome new deſigns to advance their
Conqueſts, they became ſo ſenſible (the laſt Winter) of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of the Allies Strength and Power, that far from projecting
any new Attempts upon our Frontiers, they began very early
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56660:6"/>
to provide for the defence and ſecurity of their own; they found
what ſhifts they were put to the laſt Campagne to cover their
Conqueſts in <hi>Flanders</hi> from an Invaſion; and if they ſucceeded
in the defence of it, yet the undertaking made them jealous of
our further deſigns againſt their Frontier of this ſide; this made
them reſolve to leave no way open (if poſſible) to any attempt
againſt them in this Countrey, which, bordering upon the Sea,
a Conqueſt here would be ſo much the more dangerous that it
may draw the reduction of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> after it, or at leaſt, it would
expoſe it to the hazard of a Siege, which of all their places in
the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> is the moſt important for them to maintain.</p>
            <p>The way was open from the Water of <hi>Ipre,</hi> to the <hi>Lys,</hi> and as
for their Old Line from the <hi>Lys</hi> to the <hi>Scheld,</hi> they found it of
a troubleſome length, and difficult to keep, and that it did not
ſufficiently cover their Countrey ſo long as <hi>Courtray</hi> lay expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld</hi> incline very much to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this place, which makes the diſtance between theſe two
Rivers half leſs than it is between <hi>Menin</hi> and <hi>Pont d' Eſpiers;</hi>
and therefore as for this reaſon it was ſo much the eaſier to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

ſo likewiſe it was very neceſſary for the Safety of <hi>Courtray,</hi>
which though weak of Scituation, yet could not be attack'd, as
long as they kept a Line here. For this reaſon the Enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to make a new Line between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> which
ſhould begin at St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Porte</hi> at <hi>Courtray,</hi> and ſhould terminate

ſhelter their <hi>pais conquis</hi> from any deſign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Accordingly about
the middle of <hi>March</hi> laſt, they ſummoned the <hi>Boors</hi> of all the
Countrey round about to rendezvouz at <hi>Ipre</hi> and <hi>Courtray,</hi> and
being all ready towards the latter end of the Month, the <hi>Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
de Bouflers,</hi> who re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Quarters.</p>
            <p>Upon this Motion of the Enemies, our Garriſons had orders
to be ready to march, and the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Ploen,</hi> with
the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> waited upon the Elector at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56660:7"/>
where they held a Council of War, and reſolv'd that a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Five Hundred Men out of every Battallion in Garriſon
in <hi>Flanders, Bruſſels, Malines, Louvain,</hi> and the Neighbouring
<hi>Dutch</hi> Garriſons, ſhould be drawn out to form a Camp between
<hi>Deinſe</hi> and <hi>Ghent,</hi> in order to oppoſe, if poſſible, this new work
of the Enemies. The Garriſon of <hi>Malines, Louvain,</hi> and others
the moſt remote march'd the firſt of <hi>April</hi> towards the General
Rendezvouz, and the Elector left <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> attended by the Prince
<hi>de Vaudemont,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Holſtein Ploen</hi> and <hi>Wirtembergh,</hi> and
came to <hi>Ghent</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> to put himſelf at the head of the Army.
In the mean time the Garriſons of <hi>Ghent</hi> and <hi>Bruges,</hi> with the
Regiments of <hi>Mackay</hi> and <hi>Graham</hi> from <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and <hi>Lorne</hi> from
<hi>Damme</hi> march'd, and by the <hi>6th.</hi> they were all at the General
Rendezvouz between <hi>Deinſe</hi> and <hi>Ghent,</hi> commanded by the
Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who took his Quarters at <hi>Oydonck,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Holſtein Ploen,</hi> who took his at <hi>Nevel;</hi> our Right reach'd
towards the Abbey of <hi>Drongen,</hi> and our left was at <hi>Deinſe;</hi>
and our whole Army conſiſted of about Seventy Battallions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </gap> Battallion; ſo
that our Strength was computed to be about 35000 Foot.
The Garriſons of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> did not ſtir, nor thoſe in <hi>Holland;</hi>
but the Garriſon of <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> and thoſe quarter'd in or about
<hi>Newport,</hi> had orders to be ready to march, being reinforced
with the Regiments of St. <hi>Amand</hi> and <hi>Soutlandt</hi> from <hi>Sluys.</hi> The
Cavalry drew out 30 Men of a Troop from the ſame Garriſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſo that our Army at <hi>Deinſe</hi> conſiſted of near Fifty Thouſand Men,
but the Seaſon was yet ſo early, that the Ground produc'd no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
which was ſo much the more retarded by reaſon of the
rigour of the precedent Winter, and the Troops were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
with dry Forrage from the Magazines of <hi>Ghent.</hi>

            <p>Whether 'twas to make a diverſion to oblige the Enemies to
draw off ſome of their Forces from the defence of their new Lines,

we were jealous of <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> that the Enemies might have
ſome deſign upon it, whilſt the main Body of our Army was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd

were working very buſily at their New Lines, a Train of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
was ſent from <hi>Ghent</hi> to <hi>Bruges,</hi> with an Eſcort of Five
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56660:7"/>
Hundred Dragoons,<note place="margin">April.</note> which was followed the next day with all

more; and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Dragoons
which had been quarter'd in the Winter between <hi>Ghent</hi> and
<hi>Saſvan-Ghent,</hi> marched the ſame way ſome days after, and
went to <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> where the Forces Quarter'd in the <hi>Camerlings
Ambacht</hi> (or Countrey about the <hi>Canal</hi> of <hi>Newport</hi>) had orders
to repair upon a Minutes warning, with the Regiments of
St. <hi>Amand</hi> and <hi>Soutlandt,</hi> that had marched from <hi>Sluys</hi> to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port:</hi>
But the Enemies who were reſolv'd not to be interrupted
in their Work, but to bring it to perfection, order'd all their
Garriſons in <hi>Flanders</hi> to draw out, and the Brigade of Foot-Guards,
both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> marched with all expedition
from <hi>Paris</hi> to joyn the Army near <hi>Courtray;</hi> ſo that at the ſame
time that we form'd our Army near <hi>Deinſe,</hi> they had their Main
Body with the <hi>Mareſchal de Bouflers</hi> at <hi>Belleghem,</hi> and ſufficient
Detachments to cover the <hi>Kenoque,</hi> and the New Line they
were making between <hi>Ipre</hi> and <hi>Comines</hi> upon the <hi>Lys.</hi> Of our
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide we made a Bridge upon the <hi>Lys</hi> below <hi>Deynſe</hi> to paſs that
River in caſe the forcing of the Enemies Work ſhould be judg'd

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſible. But becauſe 'twas now the beginning of the Spring, and
that it was very dangerous to hazard a Battle, which at the beſt
muſt ruine our Army though we ſhould ſucceed in beating the
Enemy from their Work, and hinder it from any other Action
of the Campagne; but if beaten and repuls'd, then the Enemies
would have remain'd Maſters of the Field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the advantage
of a whole Campagne before them: For this reaſon 'twas not
judg'd ſafe for the Intereſt of the Allyes to hazard a Battle to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to force the Enemies Work; but to remain incamp'd at
<hi>Deinſe,</hi> whil'ſt the Enemies ſhould keep the Field, to cover our
own Garriſons; which Reaſons were ſent to, and approv'd of
by the King, who was ſtill in <hi>England,</hi> expecting the Concluſion
of the Seſſions of the Parliament in order to paſs the Sea, and
put himſelf at the Head of his Army.</p>
            <p>Thus the Enemies were ſuffered to go on quietly with their
Work, which they advanc'd with all Expedition, having above
Twenty Thouſand Pioniers imploy'd, which they had ſummoned
from the <hi>Chatellenies</hi> of <hi>Liſle, Ipre,</hi> and <hi>Courtray;</hi> and from the
<hi>Paiis d' Artois;</hi> and having ſucceeded in this Work, they thought
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56660:8"/>
they had provided effectually for their defence, and reckon'd
that this advantage wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d draw the whole ſucceſs of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Campagne after it; and conſidering that their deſign was to
act Defenſively, they made as much of this Affair as if they had
got a Victory, or had taken ſome conſiderable Town, becauſe
they ſuppos'd that what they had done contributed in ſpight of
our attempts to their Wiſhes and Deſigns: For now they had a
very ſtrong barriere from <hi>Dinant</hi> to the Sea, every where co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
either with a River or a Line, which being provided with
good Troops, we muſt either force the paſſage of a River, or
their Lines to get into their Countrey. <hi>Namur</hi> clos'd up the
<hi>Meuſe</hi> and the <hi>Sambre;</hi> from <hi>Thuin</hi> on the <hi>Sambre</hi> to the <hi>Haine</hi>
they had another Line to cover the Countrey between <hi>Mons</hi> and
<hi>Maub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uge;</hi> which River running by <hi>Mons,</hi> falls into the <hi>Scheld</hi>
at <hi>Condé.</hi> The <hi>Scheld</hi> from <hi>Condé</hi> to <hi>Boſſu</hi> between <hi>Audenard</hi>
and <hi>Tournay,</hi> is a very good defence, which Nature has provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the Enemies Countrey on the other ſide, and their New
Line which they have made this year, Incloſes all their Countrey
from the <hi>Scheld</hi> to the <hi>Lys</hi> at <hi>Courtray:</hi> From <hi>Comines</hi> upon the
<hi>Lys</hi> they have continued their Line to <hi>Ipre,</hi> and from <hi>Ipre</hi> they
have a Canal which goes by the <hi>Kenoque</hi> to <hi>Furnes,</hi> and ſo to
<hi>Dunkirk,</hi> fortified with good Redoubts and Forts from place to
place. So that if we conſider the ſtrength of the Enemies Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers,
and the weakneſs of our Frontiers, it muſt very much add
to the Honour and Glory of a Conqueſt of our ſide; and we need
not much wonder at the Enemies Conqueſts, whilſt we have
acted defenſively, and have been ſo conſiderably inferiour to
them in Number in ſome of the foregoing Campagnes.</p>
            <p>The Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> Lieutenant General, who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Old Lines, being dead of an Apoplexy the laſt Winter

back into Quarters, except ſuch a Number as ſhould be neceſſary
for the defence of their Lines, with orders to be ready at firſt
warning; and it being ſo early in the Year that our Forces
could not ſubſiſt but at the Charges of dry Forrage, all the
Cavalry was ſent back into Quarters, and the Infantry of the
Neighbouring Garriſons. The <hi>Elector</hi> left the Field as ſoon as
there appeared no probability of attempting the Enemies Line,
and went for <hi>Bruſſels</hi> the <hi>16th</hi> together with the Prince <hi>de

where they were ſupplyed with dry Forrage, being near

who Commanded the Garriſon of <hi>Malines</hi> lay at <hi>Marykirk,</hi>
which were the only <hi>Engliſh</hi> left in the Field.</p>
            <p>Soon after the returning of the Forces from the Camp at <hi>Deinſe</hi>
into their Quarters, His Majeſty gave the Command in chief of
his Army to <hi>Charles Henry</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> Prince of <hi>Vaudemont,</hi>
which was ſignified by order to the Garriſons. He has always
been very zealous for the Kings Intereſt, and the Allies; and
has been a Partner in moſt of the Dangers to which the King has
expos'd himſelf from the Year, 1673, when the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
enter'd into an Offenſive and Defenſive Allyance with the States
of <hi>Holland</hi> joyntly with the Emperour and Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi>
to this time: And as ſuch long experience of the King's Heroick
Vertues muſt needs produce a very high Veneration for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
ſo the King has ſo long tryed the Spotleſs Honour, the
Undaunted Courage, and the Incomparable Judgment of this
Excellent Prince, that he has a particular Value and Eſteem for
him; All his Qualities are Charming. He is of a moſt affable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56660:9"/>
and generous temper; and has the Look and Preſence of a Perſon
of the higheſt Rank and Eminency, ſo all his Actions are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thereunto; and if the <hi>Gout</hi> and <hi>Rheumetiſmes</hi> have very
much weakned his Body, and almoſt diſabled him of his Limbs,
that is ſufficiently recompenc'd by a Vaſt Judgment, and a moſt
Solid and Clear Underſtanding. At the Battle of <hi>Landen</hi> he was
in <hi>Italy,</hi> which is the only Action in this Countrey, that he has
not been preſent at with His Majeſty ſince the laſt <hi>Holland</hi> Wars;
and when he left <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to undertake that Journey, he declar'd
that he was extremely griev'd to part with the King, and that
'twas the greateſt trouble of his Voyage. He is <hi>Governeur des
Armes</hi> to the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Forces in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which anſwers
to a <hi>Mareſchal;</hi> which Commiſſion is never given, but when
a Prince of the Royal Blood of <hi>Spain</hi> is Governour of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
When the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had this Government given him,
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> allow'd him all the Priviledges which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
Infant, and other Governours of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> have
had, and as this of having a <hi>Governeur des Armes</hi> was one, ſo Prince
<hi>Vaudemont,</hi> who before had commanded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, had
this Commiſſion given him. But without any farther Character of
this Noble Prince, what he has done in this Campagne is ſufficient
to give him a Rank amongſt the Greateſt Generals in Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The Seſſions of Parliament kept the King in <hi>England,</hi> almoſt
to the middle of <hi>May.</hi> His Majeſty landed in <hi>Holland</hi> the <hi>14th,</hi>
and as the time to open the Campagne (which was ſomething
retarded by the rigour of the precedent Winter) drew near,
the King ſpent but few days at the <hi>Hague</hi> in Conferences with
the <hi>States General,</hi> and went to <hi>Loo</hi> the 20th, to take his uſual
Divertiſement. In the mean while our Armies began to take
the Field, and as His Majeſty deſign'd Two Armies for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

great a King, and the Protector of their Countrey; the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Burghers waited upon the King in Proceſſion from the <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi>
Port, where His Majeſty was received and harangued by
the Magiſtrates; the Canon all round the Ramparts of this big
Town, which had been drawn out on purpoſe, was thrice fired;
the <hi>Militia</hi> was under Arms, making a Lane through the Streets,
and the Chief Burghers had all White Wax Torches in their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56660:10"/>
hands, in the ſame manner that they uſe to attend at their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions:
In this Ceremony the King was conducted to Monſieur
<hi>d' Auverquerque</hi>'s Lodgings, with Illuminations all along the
Streets; and a ſtately Fire-work was prepar'd upon the Clock-Houſe,
which made a very fine ſhew. Indeed the People of this
Countreys Joy was very great to ſee the King come to head the
Armies in <hi>Flanders;</hi> for when it pleaſed God to take away our
late Queen of ever bleſſed Memory, it is impoſſible almoſt to
expreſs their grief; they were afraid that the King having loſt
this admirable Partner of his Kingdoms would be obliged to
remain in <hi>England</hi> to take that care upon himſelf, which he
uſed to commit, during the Campagne, to this Wiſe and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Queen; and therefore this added ſo much the more to
Their Joy, that they were rid of this fear, and that they ſaw
His Majeſty coming to put Himſelf at the Head of the Army,
and that His Enemies could not hinder the peace and quiet of His
Kingdoms, which His Majeſty committed to the prudent and
faithful care of the Lords Juſtices. And though the King had
already made that day a long Journey from <hi>Breda</hi> to <hi>Ghent,</hi> yet
He only tarried there to refreſh Himſelf, and came that very
Night about Twelve of the Clock to the Camp at <hi>Arſeel,</hi> and
the next day His Majeſty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which would have taken up too much time. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd

Accoutr'd. The ſame day the Cavalry came to the Camp, the

makes 42000 Foot, and 82 Squadrons, whereof 26 were
Dragoons, whoſe complement is 100 a Squadron, which makes

According to this Liſt the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> had at the
General Rendezvouz of his Army 147 Squadrons, which at

an account of the Actions of theſe mighty Armies. Though
the King ordered the general Rendezvouz of his Forces in this

of the Campagne, the Kings real deſign was to beſiege
<hi>Namur,</hi> and to act towards the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> For the Elector of
<hi>Bavaria</hi> had Orders to detach my Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> with 40
Squadrons of Horſe towards <hi>Louvain;</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> of this

Brigadier <hi>Erle</hi> was commanded with a Detachment of 1700
Men to <hi>Rouſelar</hi> and <hi>Rombeck;</hi> our Pioneers had made the way
for the Army to march by <hi>Inghelmonſter</hi> and <hi>Mulenbeck,</hi> and

Army had March'd before to reinforce the Line, which was

flank'd with good Redoubts, and Cannon mounted for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of them. The King returned late to the Camp, and our
Artillery, Baggage, and Rear-Guard, was not all come up by
Midnight. Orders were given to be ready to March the next
Day.</p>
                  <p>The Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> March'd from his Camp between
<hi>Blaton</hi> and <hi>Quievrain</hi> (the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>May</hi>) to <hi>Leuze,</hi> and the

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56660:18"/>
have now ſpoken, to reinforce the Lines; and upon our motion
to <hi>Rouſelar,</hi> and ſo towards their Line between <hi>Ipre</hi> and <hi>Comines,</hi>
he paſſed the <hi>Scheld</hi> and the <hi>Lys</hi> with all diligence, and incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the main Body of his Army (that very Night we came
to <hi>Becelar</hi>) within the Line, with his Right at <hi>Sulebeck</hi> near
<hi>Ipre,</hi> his Left at <hi>Comines,</hi> and the Head Quarter at <hi>Houthem</hi>
near the <hi>Lys.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> had provided in the Winter for ſuch
quick Marches by making Royal Ways (as they call them)
where a Squadron can march a breaſt, from <hi>Mons</hi> to the <hi>Sea,</hi> to
facilitate the Marches of the Army, cutting and pulling down
all they met, without any regard to Houſes or Villages, if they
happened in the Line of the Royal Way. At the ſame time
that the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> March'd with the Main Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Ipre,</hi> to make head againſt our Forces, the Mareſchal <hi>de
Bouflers,</hi> who was incamped at <hi>Goſſelies</hi> near the <hi>Sambre,</hi> March'd
with the Body under his Command to St. <hi>Guilain,</hi> to obſerve
the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who incamped near <hi>Ninove.</hi> The
<hi>4th</hi> in the Morning the General beat for the Army to be ready
to March, and the King went again very early with a ſtrong
Detachment, to obſerve the Enemies Countenance within their
Line; Colonel <hi>Lauder</hi> Commanded the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> His Majeſty
found the Main Body of the Enemies Army incamped within
the Line, which had paſſed the <hi>Lys</hi> in the Night at <hi>Comines,</hi> and
came to incamp between <hi>Houthem</hi> and <hi>Sulebeck.</hi> Upon the
Kings approach to their Line with ſo conſiderable a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Enemy thought that it had been the Vanguard of our
Army coming to attack their Line; for which reaſon they all
immediately ſtood to their Arms: But <hi>Villeroy</hi> being come with
his Army within the Line, the King returned to the Camp, and
our Army did not ſtir from <hi>Becelar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though there was no probability of ſucceſs in forcing the
Enemies in their Lines, yet it was convenient for our further
deſigns to oblige them to bring all their Forces for the defence
of them; for which reaſon the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> decamped
from <hi>Ninove</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> and March'd that Day to St. <hi>Lievens
Houthem,</hi> towards the <hi>Scheld.</hi> The <hi>5th</hi> His Electoral Highneſs
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56660:18"/>
paſſed the <hi>Scheld</hi> below <hi>Audenarde,</hi> and incamped near this
place. The <hi>6th</hi> he March'd with his Army, and incamped
near the Enemies Line, between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> with
his Right at <hi>Tighem</hi> towards <hi>Courtray,</hi> and his Left between
<hi>Veermande</hi> and <hi>Kirkhove,</hi> and his Quarter at <hi>Caſtres.</hi> Monſieur
<hi>de Montrevel,</hi> Lieutenant-General, had been left here with a
Body of Foot for the defence of the Line from <hi>Courtray</hi> to the
<hi>Scheld,</hi> but upon this March of the Electors, the Mareſchal <hi>de
Bouflers</hi> (who had advanced from <hi>Goſſelies</hi> to St. <hi>Guilain,</hi> upon
<hi>Villeroys</hi> paſſage of the <hi>Scheld</hi> in order to obſerve the motions
of the Electors Army) March'd with his Body of Horſe and
Dragoons to <hi>Tournay,</hi> where he paſſed the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and ſo went
on to the Line, where he found a Reinforcement of Foot ſent
him by the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> and took his Quarter at <hi>Clare.</hi>
So that the Enemies had now all their Forces in the Field (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Harcourts</hi> Camp volant) from the <hi>Scheld</hi> to the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> for the defence of their Lines. The Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>de Bouflers</hi> Commanded between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld.
Villeroy</hi> with the Main Army, obſerved ours between the <hi>Lys</hi>
and <hi>Ipres.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de la Mothe</hi> cover'd the Canal from <hi>Ipre</hi>
to the <hi>Kenoque;</hi> and from thence to <hi>Furnes</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk, Montal</hi>
Commanded; and Monſieur <hi>de Capeſtan</hi> was put into the
<hi>Kenoque,</hi> for the ſecurity of that place. Beſides this the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
reinforced the Garriſon of <hi>Ipres,</hi> where they doubled the
Poſts, and took a particular care for the <hi>Sas</hi> of <hi>Bonſingue,</hi>
which is a Sluys ſtrongly fortified upon the Canal about a League
below <hi>Ipres,</hi> which if once maſter'd, all the Water about <hi>Ipres,</hi>
which adds very much to its ſtrength, may be drawn away by
letting looſe this Sluys.</p>
                  <p>This being the diſpoſition of the Enemies within their Lines,
I ſhall return to ſpeak of our own Affairs at our Camp at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celar.</hi>
The <hi>5th</hi> Major-General <hi>Dopf,</hi> Quarter-Maſter General
of the Army, was ſent with a ſtrong Detachment to mark a
Camp at St. <hi>Janſtein cappelle,</hi> which made us expect that the
Army ſhould have March'd towards <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> or the Canal of
<hi>Ipres;</hi> but I believe it was to order the March of our deſign'd
Detachments to <hi>Dixmuyde.</hi> The ſame day the Second Troop
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56660:19"/>
of Guards Commanded by the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> came to the
Camp, having been in Winter-Quarters at <hi>Breda,</hi> and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd
upon the Country to refreſh their Horſes, after having
Eſcorted His Majeſty from <hi>Breda</hi> to <hi>Ghent.</hi> The ſame day our
Bread-Waggons were attack'd by a Party upon the way to
<hi>Bruges,</hi> but the Party was repulſed, and Five and Twenty of
the Enemies made Priſoners. The Country all along, till you
come near <hi>Bruges,</hi> was ſo cloſe and woody, and ſo convenient
for lurking Parties, that our Convoys never miſſed but they
were attack'd by ſome Party or other, which though they could
gain nothing, but ſtill had the worſe, yet that incommoded our
Camp very much, by the great Detachments we were ſtill
obliged to make, being then Eight Leagues from <hi>Bruges,</hi> and
Eleven from <hi>Ghent;</hi> ſo that at firſt, Proviſions were not plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
among us, but that was ſoon taken care of by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Convoys from the Camp to <hi>Bruges:</hi> Beſides the <hi>Boors</hi> of
the Country had Orders to bring in Proviſions upon pain of
being plunder'd, which they did very willingly, not looking

Patrouilles of Horſe went ſometimes to the Paliſſades of the
Town. We heard, that though the Enemies had provided for
the defence of this place as well as their Line, yet they were
apprehenſive of a Bombardment, and began to unpave their
Streets, which we could as eaſily have done before <hi>Villeroys</hi>
face, as he afterwards Bombarded <hi>Bruſſels</hi> in the preſence of
Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> of which Exploit they brag'd ſo much in

with making it our principal glory of late to Bombard his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
places, without any other advantage but that of doing
miſchief; yet if that had been the Temper of the Allies as
much as it is of our Enemies, I believe that <hi>Ipres</hi> might have
felt the malignity of our Temper as well as <hi>Bruſſels</hi> did that of
the <hi>French.</hi>

The <hi>7th</hi> the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> with Colonel <hi>Gohr</hi> of our
Train of Artillery, went Very early in the Morning with a
good Eſcorte to <hi>Dixmuyde;</hi> and the ſame day <hi>Bannieres</hi> Brigade
was detach'd to the Right to incamp near the Abbey of <hi>Sonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi>
to guard the Avenues from <hi>Ipres</hi> to our Camp, and keep
in the Enemies Parties. The <hi>8th</hi> Major-General <hi>Churchill</hi> and
Brigadier <hi>Bernſtorf</hi> were commanded with Eight Battallions to
March, and reinforce the Duke of <hi>Wirtembergs</hi> Army near <hi>Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muyde.</hi>
The Regiments were the Firſt Battallion of <hi>Dutch</hi>
Guards, <hi>Churchill, Granville, Ingoldesby, Daniſh</hi> Guards,
Prince <hi>Philippe, Gohr-Holland</hi> and <hi>Bernſtorf;</hi> upon which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Wirtembergs</hi> to <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> ſent
a Reinforcement to the <hi>Kenoque,</hi> expecting an attempt upon
that place; and <hi>Montal</hi> himſelf came with his Body to <hi>Loo</hi>
between <hi>Furnes</hi> and <hi>Kenoque,</hi> to be at hand for the defence of
it. The <hi>9th</hi> by break of day, a Detachment of Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of the Enemies Granadiers, and Six Squadrons of Horſe,
came with a deſign to ſurprize our advanced Guard at the
Windmill of <hi>Geluvelt</hi> between <hi>Becelar</hi> and <hi>Comines.</hi> We had
here an Out-guard of Four Squadrons of Horſe, and a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of One Hundred Foot; but in the Night (the top of the
Hill being open and expoſed to the Enemy) they retir'd to ſome
Houſes and Defiles in the bottom to prevent the Enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.
This Detachment of the Enemies finding their deſign
fruſtrated, retired to their Lines, and Two of them deſerted
over to us, taking this opportunity to make their eſcape; for
though deſertion is very common among the <hi>French,</hi> yet being
incamped within their Lines, the paſſages were ſo kept that
they could not deſert but by ſuch ſhifts; and theſe were the
firſt that came in ſince our being at <hi>Becelar,</hi> ſo near the Enemies.
The ſame day Brigadier <hi>Fitspatrick,</hi> Colonel of His Majeſties
Fuſiliers, came to the Camp from <hi>England,</hi> where he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained

the <hi>7th</hi> very early in the Morning, arriv'd at <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> by

the Forces incamped near this place, conſiſting, as we have ſaid

and Eight of Dragoons; and immediately after the Review,
he ordered them to march towards the Fort of <hi>Kenoque,</hi> and
gave the plunder of the <hi>Boors</hi> between <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> and this
place to the Soldiers, in revenge of ſome which they had bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly
murder'd In the Evening the Duke came with his
Army near <hi>Kenoque,</hi> which is but a good League and a half
from <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> and incamped before the place, having his
Quarter at <hi>New Cappelle,</hi> his Right upon the Canal that goes
from <hi>Kenoque</hi> to <hi>Loo</hi> and <hi>Furnes,</hi> and his Left upon the Canal
from <hi>Kenoque</hi> to <hi>Dixmuyde.</hi> This is a very ſtrong hold, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
at the meeting of the Canal of <hi>Loo</hi> (which goes to <hi>Furnes</hi>
and <hi>Dunkirk</hi>) and the Canal of <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> and <hi>Ipres,</hi> which
makes as 'twere the figure of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Juſt upon the point of the
joyning of theſe Canals, there is a very ſtrong Baſtion in the
very middle, with the water cut about it, making a very
large and deep Foſſé. The Canals of <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> and <hi>Loo</hi>
towards <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> and of the other ſide towards <hi>Bruges,</hi> has
very good counter-guards which defend the approach of the
<hi>Digue</hi> near this Baſtion; and of the <hi>French</hi> ſide between <hi>Furnes</hi>
and <hi>Ipres,</hi> this Baſtion is covered with a ſort of Horn-work
with a boggy Moraſs before it; ſo that there is no coming into
the Fort but by a way made upon the top of the <hi>Digue.</hi> The
other ſide of the Canal toward <hi>Bruges</hi> is covered with a Moraſs
and ſtanding water, which makes it inacceſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The moſt
acceſſible ſide, where the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> was, between
the Canal of <hi>Loo</hi> and <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> has beſides the Counter-Guards
of which we have now ſpoken, which cover the Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſeveral Retrenchments all along the <hi>Digue</hi> of the Canal,
till you come to a Draw-Bridge towards <hi>Loo.</hi> But however this
is nothing to reſiſt an Army, unleſs there is a Body of Men of
the Enemies ſide of the Canals to hinder the taking of the Poſts
about it, which would then be ſoon beaten to pieces. This is a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56660:20"/>
great paſſage into the Enemies Countrey, it being open from
this to St. <hi>Omer;</hi> beſides it commands the Communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Ipres</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and would ſecure <hi>Furnes</hi> in our hands,
which conſequently would make <hi>Dunkirk</hi> a Frontier, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it to a Siege. Every body knows the conſequence of it,
if we ſhould take it, and therefore the Enemies will ſtill uſe
their utmoſt endeavours not to hazard it, by keeping this Poſt
and <hi>Furnes</hi> in their hands. This place, upon the approach of
the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> with his Army, was commanded by
Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ieur <hi>de Capeſtan,</hi> a Major of Foot. And that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the Enemies of our real deſign againſt this place was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that we had taken care before to have a Plan of it, ſome Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers
having been ſent on purpoſe to <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> the laſt March,
who went with a good Detachment from that Garriſon, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by a Lieutenant, Colonel and Major, to obſerve it.
The Garriſon of <hi>Kenoque</hi> ſallied out upon them, and attacked
that Poſt where Major <hi>Rapin</hi> of <hi>Belcaſtels</hi> Regiment had been
placed, and he had the misfortune to be killed in the action;
but this Detachment being reinforced from the Neighbouring
Poſts, the Enemies were obliged to retire, after having loſt a
Captain, and ſome other Officers wounded, beſides Soldiers.
And this little place was then ſo unprovided for ſuch engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that they were forced to ſend a Drum to <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> for
a Surgeon to dreſs their wounded Men, becauſe this Garriſon
conſiſted only of Detachments from <hi>Ipres</hi> relieved from time
to time, and ſo they had no Surgeons.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Duke of <hi>Wirtembergs</hi> arrival here the <hi>7th,</hi> we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to make Trenches to cover our ſelves, being incamped al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
within Musket-ſhot of the Enemies Works, and we
mounted our Guards towards the Enemy with Two Thouſand
Five Hundred Men upon the ſeveral Poſts, Commanded by a
Brigadier and other Officers proportionably. This Army was
divided in Four Brigades, Two of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commanded by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Tiffeny</hi> and Sir <hi>James Leſley,</hi> who acted as Brigadiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eldeſt Colonels; the third by Brigadier <hi>Haxhauſen,</hi> compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of <hi>Danes,</hi> and the Regiments of <hi>Auer</hi> and <hi>Belcaſtel;</hi> and
the fourth of <hi>Dutch,</hi> Commanded by Brigadier <hi>Bernſtorf,</hi> who
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56660:21"/>
came here with Major-General <hi>Churchill.</hi> The <hi>9th</hi> in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Enemies fired very briskly upon our Men, but without
any damage. In the Afternoon Major-General <hi>Churchill</hi> came
to the Camp with his Eight Battallions, having paſſed through
<hi>Dixmuyde</hi> that Morning. In the Evening the Duke of <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
ordered an attack to beat the Enemies from a Retrenchment,
and ſome Houſes upon our Right near the Canal of <hi>Loo,</hi> the
whole was Commanded by Colonel <hi>Tiffeny</hi> as Brigadier, and
the Granadiers by Colonel <hi>Maitland.</hi> Colonel <hi>Tiffeny</hi> was
upon the Right, and the Enemies fired very hard upon him from
a Fort of the other ſide of the Canal, which he returned very
bravely: He himſelf was wounded through the Hand with a
Musket-ſhot, and Major-General <hi>Churchill</hi> who was willing to
have a ſhare in the Action, eſcaped very narrowly, being ſhot
through the crown of his Hat with a Musket-ball. Colonel
<hi>Maitland</hi> who was to diſlodge the Enemy with his Granadiers,
did it with all the Succeſs and Conduct that could be wiſh'd,
and the Men went on with a great deal of Bravery and Courage,
and drove the Enemy from their Poſt, which they endeavour'd
in vain to recover two or three times ſucceſſively, coming on
with Sword in hand. We had ſeveral Granadiers killed and
wounded. Colonel <hi>Tiffenys</hi> and <hi>Ferguſons</hi> Regiments loſt moſt
in this Action. Of Colonel <hi>Ferguſons</hi> Regiment, Captain
<hi>Trumbal</hi> was killed, Major <hi>Bruce</hi> of <hi>Maitlands</hi> wounded, and
an Enſign killed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have not ſeen the Liſt of Colonel <hi>Tiffenys,</hi>
but it was generally computed that our whole loſs in this Action
amounted to about Four Hundred Men killed and wounded,
but they grew almoſt to Thouſands by that time they came in
the <hi>Paris</hi> Gazette, which certainly could not fall without ſome
ſlaughter among the Enemies. We had three ſmall pieces of
Cannon which played during this Attack, which is the onely
Cannon we fir'd againſt the place: The ſmall Shot was indeed
very brisk on both ſides, the whole Night, and we could hear
it very plain from our Camp at <hi>Becelar:</hi> And though it does
not appear that we had any real deſign againſt this place, but
only to amuſe the Enemy, yet it was neceſſary for us to make
this Attack becauſe the Poſts from whence we drove the Enemy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56660:21"/>
were very inconvenient to us upon our Right. The Duke of
<hi>Wirtemberg</hi> had ſome Artillery from <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> with Morter-pieces
and Bombs, but 'twas never taken out of the Boats to
mount upon the Batteries, except the three Field-pieces now
mentioned. This Artillery had been ſent by Water from <hi>Sas
van Ghendt,</hi> beſides a great quantity of Ammunitions, with the
reſt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> battering pieces, which remained under the
Walls of <hi>Ghendt,</hi> without being ſent any farther. Monſieur
<hi>de Montal,</hi> upon this motion of the Duke of <hi>Wirtembergs,</hi> had
advanced between the Canal of <hi>Loo</hi> and that of <hi>Ipres,</hi> to defend
this place, and to hinder our paſſage of the Canals to inveſt it;
ſo that nothing could be undertaken without the bringing of
both Armies to wrangle about this Poſt, and ours to attack up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
very diſadvantageous terms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that after this attack of the
<hi>9th</hi> there happened nothing extraordinary before the <hi>Kenoque,</hi>
but only in the Night they generally fired pretty briskly to
hinder our Men from making any approaches, and their Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
played ten times to our once; hovvever the Duke of
<hi>Wirtemberg</hi> ſtill continued there to keep the Enemies in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
                  <p>As for what paſſed of the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s ſide, which
we have left incamped before the Enemies Line between <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray</hi>
and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> with his Head Quarter at <hi>Caſtres,</hi> between
<hi>Tighem</hi> and <hi>Kirkhove,</hi> he made upon his arrival here great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
of Faſcines, as if he had deſigned to attack the Line:
And the <hi>8th</hi> he went with Three Thouſand Horſe and Dragoons
to obſerve the Enemies Works. They had an out-poſt at a Mill
without their Line near St. <hi>Denis,</hi> which hindered our approach,
which Major-General <hi>Fagel</hi> was ordered to attack with the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wacht
of the Army (that is a Captain, Lieutenant, and Enſign,
and Sixty Men of every Regiment, which are ſtill ready to
march out upon any occaſion, with Field-Officers proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably)
and with the Granadiers. The Enemies had here a good
Detachment, commanded with a Lieutenant-Colonel, and the
Poſt was ſtrong, and they diſputed it ſome time, but at laſt
were forced to abandon it. Count <hi>Volkerſtein</hi> of the Elector of
<hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Guards was killed upon this occaſion. As for the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56660:22"/>
loſs of both ſides, I have not ſeen an account of it. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Bavaria</hi> after this Action continued in his Camp at
<hi>Caſtres,</hi> and we at <hi>Becelar,</hi> ſtill leaving the Enemies in doubt,
whether we ſhould attack them in their Lines, whilſt matters
were preparing for an important undertaking.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt we continued in our Camp at <hi>Becelar,</hi> Forrage vvas
not very plentiful, nothing being to be had here but Graſs.
The Country hereabouts is altogether Woody, with little
Arable Land, and yet moſt of that remained untill'd (ſome
ſaid) by order, to hinder the ſubſiſting of our Armies near this
place. The <hi>10th</hi> the Enemy, who had hitherto Forrag'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their own Lines, ventured to forrage without, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
ſome deſerting among their Men, who wanted that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
within their Lines. The <hi>11th</hi> the Fourth Troop of
Guards Commanded by Monſieur <hi>d' Auverquerque,</hi> with the
Horſe Granadiers, came to the Camp, the firſt having been in
Winter-Quarters at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and the laſt at <hi>Boiſleduc.</hi> The
<hi>13th</hi> our Cavalry forrag'd towards <hi>Ipres;</hi> and this being a cloſe
Country, and juſt by an Enemies Garriſon, the Troopers went
on foot to cut down their Forrage, which was guarded by a
Detachment from the Infantry, and then the Horſes were
brought from the Camp to fetch the Forrage ready made up in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>Truſſes;
by which precaution we forrag'd thus almoſt to the
Gates of <hi>Ipres</hi> without loſing One Horſe; and indeed though
this Country is very convenient for ſuch deſigns, and that our
Camp was flank'd of both ſides, with <hi>Ipres</hi> upon the Right,
and <hi>Menin</hi> and <hi>Courtray</hi> upon the Left, and the Enemies Line
in our Front, yet we loſt but very few Horſes, there being ſtill
good Guards upon the Woods to cover our grazing, which was
ſtill done by order. The <hi>14th</hi> the King was informed that the
Enemies had a deſign upon our Bread-Waggons coming from
<hi>Bruges,</hi> and that they were to fall upon them at <hi>Rouſelar;</hi> for
which reaſon my Lord <hi>Eſſex</hi> was detached with Five Hundred
Dragoons to joyn our Convoy at <hi>Rouſelar,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
went with Five Hundred Dragoons more Commanded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

to endeavour to meet with the Enemies upon their way, being

adviſed that they were to paſs that Evening by <hi>Moorſleede;</hi>
accordingly my Lord <hi>Portland</hi> overtook them in this place, and
the Dragoons had orders to diſmount and attack them, which
they did with a great deal of Courage. The Enemies were
Commanded by a Lieutenant-Colonel, about Four Hundred
ſtrong; they had made ſome Barricades of Waggons, which
they defended no longer than to gain time to make their eſcape;
but notwithſtanding, a Captain with about Thirty Men remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Priſoners, and they had ſeveral killed and wounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The
fire was very hot for above half an hour, and the Count <hi>de
Soiſſons,</hi> who was here as Voluntier, very much incouraged our
Men, and was very well pleaſed with their way of falling on.
Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> is Brother to the Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Velt-Mareſchal
General of the Emperours Forces in <hi>Piemont,</hi> and
a near Kinſman to the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The <hi>French King</hi> would
oblige him to ſerve in <hi>Piemont</hi> with his Regiment againſt the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which he refuſed, and quitted, and retired,
with the <hi>French Kings</hi> leave, out of the Country: But the
<hi>French King</hi> hearing he was gone into <hi>England,</hi> he was ſo net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at it, that he ordered the Counteſs <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> his Wife,
immediately to leave the Kingdom. He ſerved in our Army
this whole Campagne as Voluntier, being waited upon by the
Kings own Servants; and he was ſtill with the King upon all
occaſions. He is a Perſon of a very fine Education, very civil
and obliging, and very brave, which has gained him the eſteem
and affections of all Perſons of Quality in our Army. But to
return to the buſineſs of <hi>Moorſleede;</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Webb</hi> was
killed in this occaſion, Brother to Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Webb</hi> of
the Guards. Brigadier <hi>Wynne</hi> was wounded in the Knee, which
though it was not eſteemed very dangerous at firſt, yet he dyed
afterwards of this Wound at <hi>Ghent,</hi> being generally regretted.
(The King has ſince given his Regiment of Dragoons to Colonel
<hi>Roſſe,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment who has been one of
the Kings Aide de Camps the three laſt Campagnes. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<hi>Collins</hi> and <hi>Holdgate</hi> were likewiſe wounded, both Officers

But ſuch was the order of our March, that he was obliged to
ſee us march quietly off. That day we came to <hi>Rouſela,</hi> with
our Camp as before between <hi>Hooghleed</hi> and <hi>Rombeck; Bannieres</hi>
Brigade incamped upon the Right before the Village of <hi>Hoogh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leed,</hi>
where Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> had his Quarter. The Army
halted the next day, but matters being ready for the great and
glorious undertaking of this Campagne, the King left the Camp
at <hi>Rouſelar</hi> very early the <hi>19th</hi> in the Morning, to go towards
the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> with the Troops of Life-Guards of <hi>Ormond</hi> and
<hi>Auverquerque,</hi> the Horſe Granadiers, my Lord <hi>Portlands</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Horſe, and <hi>Dopfs</hi> Dragoons Commanded by Brigadier
<hi>L'Etang:</hi> The main of which Body kept with the Kings Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks
and Baggage, but His Majeſty had a ſufficient Eſcorte
to haſten on before.</p>
                  <p>We had made great preparations at <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> of Artillery,
Mortars, Bombs, and all manner of Ammunitions; and all the
Boats of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> at <hi>Liege, Maeſtricht,</hi> and <hi>Huy,</hi> were detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the States Service. And tho' all this threatned <hi>Namur,</hi>
yet the <hi>French</hi> had brought all their Forces within their Lines,
without keeping any Body to guard the paſſages of the <hi>Sambre:</hi>
Whether it was that they thought <hi>Villeroys, Bouflers,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi>
Forces were but ſufficient to defend their Lines againſt the
King and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s; or that they depended upon
the ſtrength of <hi>Namur,</hi> and the goodneſs of the Garriſon in it,
and the difficulty of a Siege; They left the <hi>Sambre</hi> unfurniſhed
of Troops. But His Majeſty expected only the junction of the
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> Forces to inveſt <hi>Namur.</hi> Six Battallions
of <hi>Brandenburghs</hi> had had their Winter-Quarters at <hi>Liege,</hi> and
ſome at <hi>Aix la chapelle,</hi> but the Cavalry and the reſt of the Foot
had Winter'd in the Dioceſs of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and at <hi>Cleves,</hi> and
<hi>Weſel</hi> in the <hi>Lower Rhine;</hi> ſo that they did not Rendezvouz by
<hi>Liege</hi> till near the middle of <hi>June,</hi> that they marched with the
<hi>Liege</hi> Forces Commanded by Prince <hi>Cerclas</hi> of <hi>Tilly,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
at <hi>Falais,</hi> upon the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> between <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Namur,</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56660:24"/>
waiting for His Majeſties farther Orders. And my Lord of
<hi>Athlone,</hi> with his Forty Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons who
had been detached from the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Camp at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nove</hi>
for the ſame deſign, had marched to <hi>Tilmont</hi> to be ready
to joyn them. In the mean while Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Army at <hi>Rouſelar</hi> ſince the King left it to take care
of the Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> marched the <hi>20th</hi> to draw nearer to
<hi>Ghent.</hi> The Army marched upon the Left (ſiding the River
<hi>Mandel</hi> which we had upon our Right Flank) in two Columns,
by the ways we had made when we were at the Camp at <hi>Arſeel,</hi>
by <hi>Mulenbeck,</hi> and <hi>Inghelmonſter,</hi> and ſo we came to the Camp
at <hi>Wouterghem,</hi> our Right at <hi>Dentherghem,</hi> and Left at <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
towards the <hi>Lys:</hi> We had the <hi>Mandel</hi> before us, and the
height of <hi>Arſeel</hi> behind our Right. Some <hi>French</hi> Parties fell
upon our Maroders near the <hi>Lys,</hi> and made ſome Priſoners.
Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> ſtaid near <hi>Denterghem</hi> to ſee the Army march
into the Camp, and every Battallion ſaluted paſſing by him, as
Commander in Chief of the Army. At our Marching into this
Camp, we could ſee the <hi>French</hi> in their Camp upon a riſing
ground t'other ſide of the <hi>Lys,</hi> by <hi>Harlebeck,</hi> being computed
near three Leagues from our Camp. The Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi>
had paſſed the <hi>Lys</hi> at <hi>Comines</hi> immediately upon our March from
<hi>Becclar</hi> to <hi>Rouſelar,</hi> and the <hi>19th</hi> had marched without the Line
at <hi>Courtray,</hi> and incamped near this place, to be ready to paſs the
<hi>Scheld,</hi> if he was ordered to march towards <hi>Namur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have left the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> Forces incamped at
<hi>Falais</hi> upon the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Athlone</hi> at <hi>Tilmont,</hi>
where he was reinforced with <hi>Dompres</hi> Brigade of Horſe from

Accordingly my Lord <hi>Athlone</hi> marched the <hi>17th</hi> with
the Body of Horſe under his command, and incamped between

                     </hi> and <hi>Perwys:</hi> The <hi>18th</hi> between <hi>la Faliſe</hi> and <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploux,</hi>
where he was joyned by the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Troops: The
<hi>19th</hi> he left a good Body of Horſe at the Poſt of <hi>La Faliſe,</hi> and
marched with the Main Body towards <hi>Charleroy.</hi> This motion
put the Enemies in ſuſpence, whether we ſhould attack <hi>Namur</hi>
or <hi>Charleroy:</hi> Whereupon the Marquis <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> who had
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56660:24"/>
paſſed the <hi>Meuſe</hi> at <hi>Dinant,</hi> and was now poſted between <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy</hi>
and <hi>Philippeville,</hi> reinforced the Garriſon of <hi>Charleroy</hi>
with a Body of Dragoons. But my Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> having
paſſed the <hi>Sambre</hi> at <hi>Chaſſelet</hi> below <hi>Charleroy,</hi> marched again
down the <hi>Sambre</hi> towards <hi>Namur,</hi> and preſſed all the Boats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the River to make a Bridge of Communication, which were
brought down to the Abbey of <hi>Floref</hi> upon the <hi>Sambre</hi> two
Leagues above <hi>Namur.</hi> Thus my Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> took the
Poſts from the <hi>Sambre</hi> to the <hi>Meuſe</hi> of the Town ſide, about
<hi>La Faliſe;</hi> and t'other ſide of the <hi>Sambre,</hi> from the Abbey of
<hi>Floref</hi> to the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> But all the other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> in the
<hi>Pais de Condros</hi> remained open. This was the <hi>21th.</hi> I do not
know whether my Lord of <hi>Athlones</hi> Troops were not judged
ſufficient to inveſt the whole Town, which taking a vaſt Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
and divided by ſo many Rivers, might have expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
any one quarter to be forced to put a Reinforcement into
the Town; or whether my Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> had Orders to take
no other Poſts, and to ſtay for the Elector to do the reſt: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> lying open, it gave opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to the Mareſchal <hi>de Bouflers</hi> to throw himſelf into the place.
This was with Eight Regiments of the beſt Dragoons in the
Army. He had left his Camp at <hi>Clare</hi> within the Line the <hi>18th,</hi>
(the ſame day that the Elector repaſſed the <hi>Scheld</hi> to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Namur</hi>) and took along with him the Kings Dragoons,
the Dauphins, thoſe of <hi>Caylus, Grammont,</hi> St. <hi>Hamines, de
Ganges,</hi> and <hi>du Barreau;</hi> having Orders from the <hi>French King,</hi>
That if my Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> had inveſted <hi>Namur</hi> with the
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> Troops, and the Horſe under his Command, to
force his way in at any rate. But t'other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
open, he was not put to it. The ſame day <hi>Bouflers</hi>
repaſſed the <hi>Scheld</hi> at <hi>Tournay,</hi> and marched up along this River
as far as <hi>Mortaigne.</hi> The <hi>19th</hi> he came to <hi>Condé.</hi> The <hi>20th</hi>
he paſſed the <hi>Sambre</hi> at <hi>Thuin.</hi> The <hi>21th</hi> he came to <hi>Dinant,</hi>
where he paſſed the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> and the <hi>22th</hi> he got into <hi>Namur.</hi>
He ſent back all the Dragoons Horſes, except thoſe of the
Kings, and <hi>Asfeldt Eſtranger,</hi> which he kept in the Town;
having made very great diligence to get in before my Lord of
<hi>Athlone</hi> ſhould be joyned by the Elector of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> His get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56660:25"/>
into the place did chagrine us at firſt, becauſe that (as we
expected) would render the taking of the Town very difficult,
by an obſtinate reſiſtance; but as it has ſince proved, it has
added extreamly to the Glory of the Siege, and has made it
one of the boldeſt and fineſt undertakings of this Age. I dare
ſay, that if the <hi>French King</hi> had believed that we could have
taken <hi>Namur</hi> with the ſtrong Garriſon that was in it, he would
never have commanded a Mareſchal of <hi>France</hi> to put himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it to defend it, to add thereby ſo much the more Honour and
Glory to the Enterprize; being it may be the firſt that has been
defended by a Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> with order from the King.
The Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> defended <hi>Treves,</hi> but every body
knows how he was forced into it by the loſs of a Battle; and
this was a place of Refuge where he made his eſcape, and
where he reſolved to regain his Honour by a deſperate defence.</p>
                  <p>My Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and Baron <hi>Heyden</hi> with
the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Forces, having received Orders to take the
Poſts near <hi>Namur,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Holſtein Ploen</hi> marched with all ſpeed from their Camp near
the Enemies Line to form the Siege of this ſtrong and important
place. Accordingly the <hi>18th</hi> the Electors Army decamped
from <hi>Caſtres</hi> between <hi>Veermarde</hi> and <hi>Tighem,</hi> and repaſſed the
<hi>Scheld</hi> below <hi>Audenarde,</hi> and marched that day as far as St.
<hi>Lievens Houtheim.</hi> The <hi>19th</hi> this Army paſſed the <hi>Dender</hi> at
<hi>Ninove,</hi> where it incamped that night, and the Elector went
to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to viſit the Electoreſs. The <hi>20th</hi> the Army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Halle.</hi> The <hi>21th</hi> it paſſed the <hi>Senne,</hi> and marched to
<hi>Genap</hi> and <hi>Promell,</hi> where the Elector returned to the Camp
from <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> The <hi>22th</hi> the Elector paſſed with his Army
the little River <hi>Dyle</hi> at <hi>Genap,</hi> and marched as far as <hi>Maſy,</hi>
within Two Leagues of <hi>Namur;</hi> which was a very great
March, to paſs ſo many Rivers, from the Enemies Line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld</hi> clear to the <hi>Sambre,</hi> in five days.
The ſame day the King came to the Camp near <hi>Namur,</hi> and
took his Quarter at the <hi>Chaſteau de la Falize,</hi> within Four
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles of this place, having left his Army at <hi>Rouſelar</hi> the
<hi>19th;</hi> and that day His Majeſty paſſed through <hi>Ghent,</hi> and lay

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56660:25"/>
                     <hi>Dermonde,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Grimberg</hi> near <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where the King

<hi>L' Etang</hi> marched after with eaſier Journeys, eſcorting the
Kings Domeſticks and Baggage. The <hi>23th</hi> the Elector paſſed
the <hi>Sambre</hi> with his Foot, and ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, with the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Brigades of <hi>Holſtein Norburg</hi> and <hi>Dedem,</hi> and took his
Quarter at the Abbey of <hi>Malogne</hi> upon the <hi>Sambre;</hi> and the
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> Forces, Commanded by Lieutenant-General <hi>Heyden,</hi>
paſſed the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and took their Poſt on the other ſide of this
River, upon the height of St. <hi>Barbe,</hi> before the <hi>Fauxbourg de
Jambe.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Holſtein Ploen</hi> remained of this ſide of
the <hi>Sambre</hi> and <hi>Meuſe</hi> with the King, and the reſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Forces. And now the Poſts being taken all about <hi>Namur,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Town and the Caſtle, and the other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi>
'tis from this day (23) that we muſt reckon the inveſting of it.</p>
                  <p>This place has very much changed condition ſince it fell
into the <hi>French Kings</hi> hands, who ſpares no Charges to put his
Frontier Garriſons in the beſt condition of defence. When the
<hi>French</hi> took it, the Town was but weak, being abſolutely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by a ſteep Hill, which hangs juſt over it from the <hi>Porte
de Fer</hi> to that of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> near the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> ſo that they had
the liberty to bring down their Batteries at firſt upon the deſcent
of this Hill, and to open their Trenches at the foot of it near
the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> and ſo in four or five days time they were lodged
upon the Counterſcarp of St <hi>Nicholas</hi> his Gate; and the Town
capitulated the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> the Trench having been opened
the <hi>19th.</hi> But now to add a conſiderable ſtrength to this weak
part of the Town, the <hi>French</hi> had made a detach'd Baſtion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the aſcent of the Hill juſt before St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s Gate, all of
Stone-work, with a Caſematte upon it, (that is a <hi>Corps de Garde</hi>
Bomb proof) the Counterſcarp of the Foſſe of Free-ſtone, and
the covered way the ſame, which pointed juſt upon the top of
the Hill, ſo that no Cannon could bear upon this Work from
the Plain upon this Hill, but we battered it in revers from the
other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> at the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Batteries, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
ſome time before we could bring theſe Batteries to the
Water-ſide. Upon the Right of this towards the <hi>Porte de Fer,</hi>
they had made two other detach'd Baſtions of the ſame work
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56660:26"/>
juſt upon the brow of the Hill; and at the foot of the Hill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Porte de Fer,</hi> and between the Hill and the Brook of
<hi>Verderin,</hi> they had a fourth, which hindered the Avenues between
the Hills to this Gate. The Brook of <hi>Verderin</hi> runs along a
narrow Valley between theſe Hills by a Sluyce fortified juſt at
the <hi>Porte de Fer.</hi> It is by this Sluyce that the Foſſé of the Town
is furniſhed with Water from this Gate to that of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi>
where it's ſtop'd up from running into the <hi>Meuſe</hi> by a Stone
Digue above Ten Foot broad: For this River is ſo ſhallow and
inconſiderable, that it could not otherwiſe fill the Foſſé. The
Plain upon theſe Hills is fortified with a double cover'd way
paliſſaded, to defend theſe detach'd Baſtions towards the Village
of <hi>Bouge;</hi> and when we attack'd the place, they were work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at a third nearer to the brow of the Hill juſt before theſe
works; ſo that this Town which before was weak, was really
ſtrong by the addition of them, and held out longer than the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> attack'd the Caſtle and <hi>Cohorne</hi> upon the top of
the Hill between the <hi>Sambre</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> and this they took
care to fortifie afterwards, ſo as to leave it almoſt unattackable
the ſame way they had took it before. The <hi>Cohorne,</hi> or <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>
Fort, fell into their hands by driving their Trenches round
the work along the bottom, between it and the <hi>Terra Nova,</hi>
or upper Caſtle, which work being embraced, and all manner
of Communication cut off, was forced to ſurrender. The
<hi>French</hi> to prevent ſuch a method of proceeding another time,
built a ſtrong Stone Redoubt juſt upon the top of the Hill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Cohorne</hi> and <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> with a Caſematte upon it
Bomb proof; and this work commands all this bottom to the
<hi>Sambre.</hi> Before this work they have made a very good cover'd
way paliſſaded, from the Angle of the Gorge of the <hi>Cohorne</hi> to
the brink of the Hill upon the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> They have beſides this
made a very good Half-Moon upon the courtin of the Horn-work
of the <hi>Terra Nova.</hi> They have fortified the <hi>Devils</hi> Houſe,
(which flanks the ſide of the <hi>Cohorne</hi> towards the <hi>Meuſe</hi>) with
a ſtrong Stone Redoubt, which they have called <hi>the Caſotte.</hi>
This Houſe, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had it, had but a ſimple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment
about it, and yet it held out four or five days. From
the upper point of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> which is towards the <hi>Meuſe,</hi>
they have made a very good cover'd way, which goes about be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56660:26"/>
                     <hi>the Caſotte</hi> to the edge of the Hill upon the <hi>Meuſe:</hi> And
beyond all this, to cover the whole from the <hi>Sambre</hi> to the
<hi>Meuſe,</hi> they had undertaken a prodigious Line cut into the very
Rock, all along the top of the Hill, near an <hi>Engliſh</hi> half Mile
in length, terminating upon the edge of the Hill towards the
<hi>Sambre,</hi> and the ſame Hill towards the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> with two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts
at each end. The Line was finiſhed, and the Redoubt
towards the <hi>Meuſe</hi> was very forward; but that towards the
<hi>Sambre</hi> was but juſt begun, which they made up with Faſcines
upon our arrival before this place. This Line had a very fine
Gate in the middle, ſuch as they uſe to make for the coming in
to their Towns, but 'twas not finiſhed. It would have been
very difficult to have forced this Line from without, but the
paſſage of the <hi>Sambre</hi> at the <hi>Ballance</hi> not being fortified by the
Enemy, it made way for us to attack this Line within; which
made it but a cheap bargain (as we ſhall tell hereafter): How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to add as much ſtrength to it of this ſide as the time of the
Siege would allow them, they made a Battery of two pieces of
Cannon upon the reverſe of the end of the Line towards the
<hi>Sambre</hi> to fire upon the paſs of the <hi>Ballance,</hi> and ſome <hi>Coupeures</hi>
or Traverſes to fortifie the inſide of their Line, and a Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
Line of Communication to the cover'd way of the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſote.</hi>
And indeed the Caſtle was ſo ſtrongly fortified upon the
top of the Hill with all theſe Outworks, that it would have
been a very tedious piece of work for us to have attack'd it this
way: But the weak ſide of the Caſtle and <hi>Cohorne</hi> was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Town and the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and the Enemies had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for an Attack of this ſide, which made all theſe prodigious
works fall into our hands in leſs time than the <hi>French</hi> had taken
this place before; tho' then much inferiour to what 'tis now in
Strength and Fortification.</p>
                  <p>If the Enemies had reaſon to depend upon the great ſtrength
of this Garriſon, they had as much reaſon to expect a vigorous
reſiſtance from the Forces that were in it, which were very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
no leſs than twenty Battallions, of which ſome were
the beſt reputed Regiments of <hi>France;</hi> but others, about four
or five, being what they call Regiments <hi>de Salade,</hi> that is, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
Regiments, which are not fit to put into the Field. Their
old <hi>Corps</hi> have generally one or two of theſe Battallions, where
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56660:27"/>
they train and exerciſe their Recruits and worſe men for one
Summer, and then they draw them out the Campagne follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Theſe Regiments are always weak, and therefore cannot
come up to the computation of other Battallions; but I believe
that all theſe Battallions put together may very well be compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
450 Men ſtrong, one with another, which makes 9000 Foot;
and 8 Regiments of Dragoons which march'd out 3 Standards
each Regiment, which makes 24 Squadrons, which if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
would amount to 2400 Dragoons; but I dare ſay that
(conſidering their haſty and quick March from the <hi>Scheld</hi> to this
place, by the <hi>Sambre</hi> and <hi>Dinant</hi>) they could not exceed 2000
Men. There was beſides 6 Independent Companies in the Town,
and Artificers, Miners, and Gunners; all which joyn'd together
made about 12000 effective Men at the beginning of the Siege.
But for the more particular ſatisfaction of the Reader, I ſhall

Mareſchal <hi>de Bouſters,</hi> known for his Zeal and Fidelity to the

Hitherto the <hi>French</hi> were not much diſturbed by us in the Town of
<hi>Namur;</hi> for we had not yet broke ground before the place; and the
Water of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> was ſo low that we could not get our Cannon up
ſo ſoon as we expected; for when they were come up to <hi>Huy,</hi> the
River was found ſo ſhallow, that we were forced to unload our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
and put them in leſſer Veſſels to bring them; which as it requir'd
time, ſo conſequently it retarded very much the vigorous proſecution
of the Siege: Nevertheleſs the King, with the Elector, went every
day to viſit the Poſts near the Town, and among the reſt, <hi>July 1ſt,</hi>
as the King was riding near the Town to obſerve the Enemies works,
a Lieutenant and Cornet of Dragoons deſerted from the Enemy, and
came to the King, pretending themſelves to be of <hi>Liege,</hi> and that they

We were ſo long before <hi>Namur</hi> without breaking ground againſt
the Town, that people began to talk very variouſly about this Siege;
as if we had not deſign'd it, but rather (having lodg'd a ſtrong Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
in this place) to undertake an eaſier work, and beſiege <hi>Charleroy;</hi>
for from the <hi>23th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> that the Town was inveſted, to this time,
we had done nothing but work'd at our Line of Circumvallation, and
made our Bridges of Communication; one upon the <hi>Sambre,</hi> between
<hi>Flavennes</hi> and the Abbey of <hi>Malogne;</hi> the ſecond upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi>
above <hi>Namur,</hi> towards <hi>Dinant;</hi> and the third upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> below
<hi>Namur,</hi> towards <hi>Huy.</hi> But the true reaſon of our ſlowneſs proceeded
from our want of Cannon, part of which came up the laſt day of <hi>June;</hi>
and then we opened the Trenches the day following, being the
<hi>1ſt</hi> day of <hi>July.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> broke ground at night near the Village
of <hi>Bouge,</hi> upon the Plain, before the Retrenchments and cover'd
ways the Enemies had made upon this Hill from whence the
Town is commanded. Major-General <hi>Fagel</hi> had the Trenches,
with ſix <hi>Dutch</hi> Battallions. We did not advance our work very
far this night, becauſe the Trench was flank'd from the Caſtle,
which could eaſily fire over the Town here; for which reaſon we
were obliged to make Traverſes in the Trench to cover our ſelves from
the Cannon of the <hi>Terra Nova;</hi> ſo that the Work could not be ſo
far advanced as it would have been, if we had been obliged only to
make a ſimple Trench. The Enemies fired very briskly to hinder
our Workmen, particularly from an old Tower which they had juſt
before their cover'd way, called <hi>la Tour de Cocklé.</hi> The <hi>Brandenburgs</hi>
of t'other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> work'd to make a Battery upon the
height of St. <hi>Barbe,</hi> to beat in reverſe upon the Enemies within their
covered way upon the Hill of <hi>Bouge.</hi> The <hi>2d</hi> Major General <hi>Saliſch</hi>
had the Trenches, and Major General <hi>Fagel</hi> had the misfortune to be
ſhot in the Neck as he was diſmounting, but without danger. We
work'd at a little battery of three pieces of Cannon near the Village
<hi>de Bouge,</hi> to play upon the Tower of <hi>Cocklè;</hi> and this night we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
conſiderably our Trenches; and in both theſe nights we had not

and <hi>George Hamilton,</hi> with Brigadier <hi>O Farrel,</hi> came
from <hi>Deinſe</hi> to the Camp to reinforce our Army, the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
being ſupplyed by Detachments. Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi>
had then about fifty Battallions, and fifty one Squadrons
of Horſe and Dragoons; and with theſe Forces he was
then reſolved to expect the Marechal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> and
to venture the iſſue of a Battle in his Retrenchments,
which he had made very ſtrong; though <hi>Villeroy</hi> had near
the double of his number, and that Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi>
had not above 36000 men. Whilſt we were working
at our Retrenchments at <hi>Arſeel,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Marechal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> was marching in

and moted, from whence he interrupted the Enemy's
march for ſome time, who had a Colomne to march

would not ſurrender till they brought Cannon againſt

him; and then he ſurrender'd himſelf and Detachment
Priſoners of War. Some of the <hi>French</hi> Officers would
have had him made an Example, for pretending to
hinder the march of a Royal Army with a handful of
men, but on the contrary, the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi>
approved of his Courage and Bravery, and was pleas'd
to applaud it.</p>
                  <p>The Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> came early enough in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of our Army that day to have attack'd it, and to
have decided the Fate of our Army by a Battle: But
whether it was that he found our Camp ſtrongly forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and that he would not then hazard it, or that he
had orders to ſtay till <hi>Montal</hi> bad taken the Poſts in the
Rear of our Right, between <hi>Arſeel</hi> and <hi>VVirk,</hi> to attack
us there, and that he thought it more ſure and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to ſtay till then. He remained in preſence of our
Army that Evening, expecting to have attack'd the
P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ince very early the next morning, and, in a manner, to
have caught him in a Net, by invironing him upon the
Right. Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> was informed of this motion of
Monſieur <hi>de Montal</hi>'s. Our Army was then poſted in the
Retrenchment, expecting the Enemy; and though <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
had already paſs'd <hi>Thielt,</hi> and was drawing near to
<hi>Caneghem,</hi> Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> chang'd Reſolution, and
thought it very hazardous to venture a Battle which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
the total ruin of his Army; and then, though the
time was urgent and preſſing, he immediately, with a

a Retreat. The Prince had very wiſely provided for ſuch
an Accident in the morning, by ordering all the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
to load immediately, and to march by <hi>Deinſe</hi> to <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ent,</hi>
that it might not embarraſs the motions of the Army. The
Prince order'd firſt the Cannon to be drawn off the Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and to march towards <hi>Deinſe;</hi> which was done ſo
ſecretly, that the Enemies did not perceive it. He had
wiſely ordered the Artillery to be moving from Battery to
Battery all the Afternoon, ſo that when it went clear
off, the Enemies thought it had been but the ordinary
motion. After, the two Lines of Foot march'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56660:31"/>
the Left, along the Retrenchment. To cover this
march of the Foot, the Prince ordered a Body of Horſe
to come and poſt in the Retrenchment, as 'twas quitted
by the Foot. The Foot march'd with their Pikes and
Colours trailing to conceal their march; neither did the
Enemies perceive this motion till the Cavalry mounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and abandon'd the Retrenchment, and then the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
was already got in the bottom between <hi>Arſeel</hi> and
<hi>VVouterghem,</hi> marching towards <hi>Deinſe.</hi> At the ſame time
that the Foot were filing off from the Retrenchment, the
Prince ordered Monſieur <hi>d Auverquerque,</hi> with the Right
Wing of Horſe, interlin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Winck.</hi> This motion was to make <hi>Montal</hi> believe that
this Line was deſign'd to oppoſe his Attempt upon the
Rear of our Right; but his ſecret Orders were to march
off by <hi>Winck</hi> to <hi>Nevel,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Ghent.</hi> At the ſame
time that the Foot march<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d by <hi>Wouterghem</hi> and <hi>Deinſe,</hi> my
Lord <hi>Rochford,</hi> who was poſted with the Left Wing of
Horſe and two Battallions towards the <hi>Lys,</hi> made the
Reer Guard towards the Left, with a Line of Foot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one ſide, and three Squadrons of <hi>Eppinger</hi> upon the
other. All this was ſo contriv'd by the Prince, from the
Right to the Left, that the Army diſappear'd all at once,
juſt as if it had vaniſhed out of the Enemy's Sight. The
Prince, and the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and other Generals,
kept to the Retrenchments till all was marched off; form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with themſelves, Domeſticks and Attendants, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Body of Horſe, ſtill to impoſe upon the Enemy, and
followed the Army as ſoon as 'twas all got off. The
Enemies finding themſelves cheated, did what they could
to overtake and fall upon our Rear: <hi>Montal</hi> particularly
endeavoured to fall upon that Body commanded by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>d' Auverquerque,</hi> which march'd off by <hi>Winck</hi> to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi>
He overtook the Rear with ſome Squadrons of Horſe
and Dragoons: But our Defilés were good, and Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
<hi>Collier</hi> had ordered all the Granadiers of his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade
to the Rear of all, to face the Enemy from time to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56660:31"/>
time as they advanced in their Defilès; which was ſo well
contrived, that the Granadiers with their Fire kept the
Enemies at a diſtance, and made the Retreat good, and
<hi>Montal</hi> could not do us the leaſt harm. When they had
fail'd here, they endeavoured to fall upon the Rear of
our body of Foot, which was brought up by Count <hi>de
Noyelles</hi> Lieutenant-General. They ordered a Line of
Foot to advance, with ſome Horſe and Dragoons; but
the Foot was got already ſo far that they could not hurt
them. However two Squadrons of their Dragoons put
green Boughs in their Hats, which is our ſign of Battle,
and ſpoke ſome <hi>French</hi> and ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as if they had
been ſome of our own Reer-Guard: It was then the
dusk of the Evening; and with this Stratagem they were
ſuffered to come up cloſe to our Rear of Foot, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with them a little way, till they came to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
place, that they fir'd upon our Rear, and then
fell in with their Swords. This put the firſt Battallion
in great diſorder; but the other immediately facing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
oblig'd the Enemies to retire. They kill'd us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Men, and made ſome Priſoners: The <hi>Lunenburgh</hi>
Regiment of <hi>Luck</hi> ſuffered moſt in this occaſion. And
this is the only loſs we receiv'd from the Enemy in this
great and renowned Retreat; which is as fine a piece of
the Art of War as can be read of in Hiſtory, and which
can hardly be parallell'd in it; which has ſhew'd more
the Art, Conduct, and Prudence of a General, than if
the Prince had gain'd a conſiderable Victory: And this
is the Senſe his Majeſty was pleas'd to expreſs of it in
a Letter he writ to Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> upon this occaſion.
By this Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> bafled all the Enemy's Deſigns,
which aimed at no leſs than the loſs of <hi>Flanders,</hi> by the
ruin of his Army; and for this Reaſon had laid aſide all
thoughts of beſieging <hi>Ath</hi> or <hi>Audenarde,</hi> to get <hi>Newport,</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ſo to have a paſſage free within our Canals, which
cover the <hi>Spaniſh Flanders.</hi> This would not only have
been the Conſequence of the Prince's defeat, but likewiſe
the raiſing of the Siege of <hi>Namur</hi> muſt have follow'd it.</p>

The Prince having made his Retreat in this order,
and the Army being paſs'd <hi>Deinſe,</hi> and got as far as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi>
in the way to <hi>Ghent,</hi> 'twas ordered to halt, and reſt
there for that night: But Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> (as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
afterwards ſaid it) remembred a Maxim of that
Great General, <hi>Charles</hi> IV. Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> his Father;
That when an Army is upon the Retreat, it muſt be
ſure to retreat out of the Enemy's reach; for which
Reaſon he ſent Orders to Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſis</hi> to march
immediately with the Foot to <hi>Ghent;</hi> and the Army
came to <hi>Mary-K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without <hi>Bruges-Port;</hi> and it was all got here by ſix a
Clock the next morning. Whilſt the Army was upon
the halt at <hi>Nevel,</hi> Major-General <hi>Churchill,</hi> being juſt by
the Houſe where he had his Quarter the laſt Spring, when
we form'd a Camp between <hi>Deinſe</hi> and <hi>Ghent</hi> (as the
Enemies were working at their new Lines) went in, to
reſt himſelf, and ordered a Sergeant and twelve Men of
the next Regiment for a Guard upon it: But as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
marched on, the Regiment did not ſend to call off the
Sergeant and his twelve Men, and the whole Regiment
and Army march'd without their knowledge; they ſtill
expected to have found the Army by them the next
morning; Major General <hi>Churchill,</hi> being fatigu'd, went
to ſleep; Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Godolphin</hi> of Sir <hi>Bevil Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>'s
Regiment was with him, and Major <hi>Negus</hi> of the
Major-General's Regiment, and Captain <hi>Lloyd</hi> his <hi>Aide de

(the reſt being diſpers'd Centries) into the Houſe: It
prov'd that it was no Party, but Maroders of the Army,
who came to plunder the Country. The ſix Soldiers
being got into the Houſe, and the Doors ſhut up, fir'd
upon the <hi>French,</hi> which made them retreat. In the
mean time the Major-General made all haſte to endeavour
to make his eſcape; and being got out of the Houſe,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56660:32"/>
the <hi>French</hi> Maroders had rally'd with their Camarades to
force the Houſe; ſo he fell in the Hands of two of them,
who plunder'd him, took his Gold, his Watch, his
Coat, and Cravat; but being jealous of one another, they
were for dividing immediately the Spoil; and ſo they
ſpoke to the Major-General to ſet down by a Hedge,
and that if he offered to ſtir, they were ſo many about
the Houſe that they would certainly ſhoot him. They
got on the other ſide of the Hedge to ſhare that which
they would not truſt with one another: Whilſt they
were buſie at this work, the Major-General ſeeing no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to obſerve him, ſlipp'd to the other ſide of another
Hedge hard by; and ſo having two Hedges between him
and them, he got out of their ſight. He paſs'd by one
of their Centries, who took him for one of the <hi>French</hi>
Army, and ask'd him which way the Army march'd,
to which the Major-General anſwer'd accordingly,
and ſo made his eſcape, and got to our Army at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Kirk,</hi>
having marched moſt on Foot in his Boots. As
for Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Godolphin,</hi> Major <hi>Negus,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Lloyd,</hi> which were ſtill in the Houſe, they had not ſo
good Fortune; but the Houſe was ſoon invironed: The
Maroders came with a Drum to make them believe they
had an Officer with them; and ſo theſe Gentlemen, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
good Treatment from an Officer, yielded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Priſoners of War: But as ſoon as the Door was
open, the mobb of Soldiers got in, and fell on plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
There was a great deal of Baggage in the Houſe,
as Saddles and Furniture for Horſes, and in the Barn ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
good Horſes. Thoſe that got in firſt minded only
the Plunder; others follow'd, who finding no other
Booty, ſtripp'd Colonel <hi>Godolphin</hi> naked, and had him away
Priſoner in this condition: Major <hi>Negus</hi> and Captain <hi>Lloyd</hi>
were not treated quite ſo ill, having ſome of their Cloaths
left them. But they were all carried Priſoners to the

caus'd an univerſal Joy before the Town, and diſſipated

Trench upon the Right of the Enemys Retrenchment,
directing their Approaches towards the old Tower of
<hi>Cocklé;</hi> That three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiments ſhould mount the
Trenches here, and three <hi>Dutch</hi> upon the Left towards
the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> where they had opened the Trench, near
the Village of <hi>Bouge.</hi> Accordingly in the Evening, my
Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> Brigadier was commanded with the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Royal, <hi>Selwyn,</hi> and <hi>Trelawny,</hi> for this Work;
and Major-General <hi>Saliſch</hi> had the Trenches. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginier
miſſed in the night the Ground where we were to
begin to work, which was in a bottom upon the Right
of the Enemy's Rettenchment or covered way: And ſo
theſe three Regiments returned without breaking Ground.
The 6th. Major-General <hi>Lindeboom</hi> mounted the Trenches,
and Brigadier <hi>Fitzpaterick,</hi> with the Regiments of <hi>Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>
and <hi>Columbine</hi> (being that lately commanded by the
Marquiſs <hi>de Rada,</hi> Son to the Marquiſs <hi>de Montpouillan,</hi>
who dyed of a <hi>Fever</hi> at <hi>Bruges</hi> the beginning of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,
and the Regiment was given to Lieutenant-Colonel
<hi>Columbine,</hi> Captain of the Guards, who had been
Lieutenant-Colonel to it in the time of Colonel <hi>Babington</hi>)
the third was the Regiment of <hi>Fuſiliers.</hi> This night
theſe Regiments opened the Trench before the Enemy's
covered way upon the Hill of <hi>Bouge,</hi> taking the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of the hollow ground to begin their work very
near the Enemy. Captain <hi>Thilips</hi> of <hi>Selwyn</hi>'s Regiment
was wounded with the Workmen: Thus the Trenches
were mounted upon the Right by the King's Forces,
three Battallions commanded by a Brigadier; and
by the States Forces, three Battallions upon the Left,
commanded by a <hi>Dutch</hi> Brigadier, making two At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks
upon Right and Left, under the Command of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56660:34"/>
a Major-General. 200 men were commanded every night
upon each Attack, with two Captains, and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
proportionably to work and advance the Trenches,
whilſt the Regiments of the Trenches covered their
Work (which they did under the ſhelter of Wooll-ſacks)
with their Fire; which generally continued more or leſs
the whole Night. The 7th. Major-General <hi>Heukelom</hi> had
the Trenches, with my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi>'s Brigadier upon the
Right, and the Battallions of <hi>Tidcomb, Stanley,</hi> and <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingwood.</hi>
(I could not get a Liſt of the rowling of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Brigadiers and Regiments upon the Left, ſo that
I muſt paſs it over.) Captain <hi>Gaubet</hi> of Colonel <hi>Ingoldeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>'s
Regiment and Enginier, and another Enginier of <hi>la
Meloniere</hi>'s Regiment were killed in the Work this night.</p>
                  <p>The 8th. ſeveral of the Regiments encamp'd at <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploux</hi>
had Orders to march in the Lines of Circumvalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being the firſt Battallion of the Royal Regiment, the
Fuſiliers, <hi>Ingoldesby, Saunderſon, Maitland,</hi> and <hi>Lauder.</hi>
We continued ſtill to fire with our ſmall Battery upon
the Hill againſt the old Tower, and among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſades
of the cover'd way. The <hi>Brandenburghers</hi> did the
ſame from their Battery upon the edge of the Hill of St.
<hi>Barbe;</hi> but being too far from the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and to fire
over this River upon the Enemy in their Works upon
the Hill of <hi>Bouge,</hi> it could not do very great execution:
But to make more ſerviceable Batteries of this ſide,
and to bring them nearer to the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the <hi>Brandenburghs</hi>
had opened the Trench (the 1ſt.) againſt the Enemy's
Work, which they had to cover the <hi>Fauxbourgh de Jambe,</hi>
to drive them out of this place. The Caſtle commanded
all the bottom between the height of St. <hi>Barbe</hi> and the
<hi>Meuſe;</hi> for which reaſon the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Troops were
forced at firſt to open their Trench very high up the
<hi>Meuſe</hi> towards the Bridge of Communication, and ſo to
work downwards towards the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and
by this time they had conſiderably advanced their Work.
But this day the Enemy made a Sally about two in the
Afternoon upon the <hi>Brandenburghers</hi> Trenches, which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56660:35"/>
was commanded by a Colonel, The Enemy were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
about 1200 ſtrong, being moſt Dragoons, and two
Squadrons of them mounted: The <hi>Brandenburghers</hi> were

was killed, being a <hi>French</hi> Refugié, a Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel,
and 100 Soldiers killed and wounded. The Enemies
levelled 150 paces of their Trenches; but the <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>burghers</hi>
rallied, and being reinforced with ſome Horſe,
they regain'd their Poſt, and drove the Enemy back to
the <hi>Fauxbourgh de Jambe,</hi> who had the Count <hi>de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
Colonel of Dragoons wounded upon this occaſion,
and about thirty men killed and wounded. This is the
only Sally the <hi>French</hi> made during the Siege of the
Town.</p>
                  <p>In the Evening Major-General <hi>Ramſay</hi> was commanded

had upon the Hill of <hi>Bouge,</hi> with the five Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions

Siege; the other two remained with Prince <hi>Vaudemont:</hi>
Theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>attallions were two of the firſt Regiment of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Guards, the <hi>Coldſtream</hi> Battallion of Guards, of
which my Lord <hi>Cuts</hi> is Colonel, the firſt Battallion of
<hi>Dutch</hi> Guards, and the firſt of <hi>Scots</hi> Guards, beſides a
Detachment of fifteen Grenadiers throughout the other
Regiments of his Majeſty's Forces here. The Attack
was diſpoſed on this manner: This Body was to form
two Attacks, the one upon the Right of the Tower of
<hi>Cocklé,</hi> the other upon the Left, each Attack to begin
with 120 Fuſiliers commanded for that purpoſe out of
the Regiments, and 120 Grenadiers; the Fuſiliers to
march firſt, each carrying a large Faſcine before him, and
his Fuſil ready, being drawn up in three Ranks; the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers
immediately to follow, each to carry three
Grenades; they were to advance in this manner towards
the Line which they were to attack, and then, when
they were come within forty paces of the Enemy's Work,
the Grenadiers were to divide to the Right and Left of
the Fuſiliers, and to fire their Arms by Pelottons, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56660:35"/>
then to advance clear to the Enemy's Paliſſades to fire in
their Grenades, after that, the Fuſiliers were to throw down
their Faſcines, and then to make all the Fire they could;
the Grenadiers were to be followed by 100 Workmen
to each Attack, and two or three Ingeniers, the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to carry Wooll-ſacks and Gabions, and poſt them
moſt conveniently to drive the Enemy from their Works;
100 Grenadiers beſides were to carry Faſcines, as the Fuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,
and march equally with them, and 50 men behind
them, with an Enginier to plant them as the reſt; and theſe
were to march in the Center, between the two Attacks,
againſt the old Tower; as many Grenadiers were to be
diſpoſed in the ſame manner upon the Right of all; the
Battallions were immediately to follow, and ſuſtain
the Fuſiliers and Granadiers, and drive the Enemy from
their Works. The firſt Paliſſades being gain'd, we were
to lodge our ſelves there, and to make uſe of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
rais'd Work for a Parapet: The Regiments in the
Trenches were to be ready to march out, and ſuſtain
them upon occaſion; the Signal, to be one of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
Colours raiſed upon the higheſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Trenches, and then all were to fall on; which was
accordingly done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bout ſeven in the Evening. Major-General
<hi>Ramſay</hi> ordered none of the Battallions ſhould
fire till they could put their Pieces in the Enemies Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſades,
and to march with their Arms ſhoulder'd,; which
he ſaw executed himſelf. The Guards march very bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with their Arms ſhoulder'd, and ſuſtained the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Fire till they came up to the Paliſſades, and then
they gave a full fire, which put the <hi>French</hi> in ſome
confuſion:. Nevertheleſs they ſtill diſputed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment;
and after a little time they were forced
to quit it, and the Guards remain'd Maſters of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſade.
The Enemies Paliſſades being gain'd, the Major-General
order'd our Men to break them, and to get into
the cover'd way: Our Soldiers being fluſhed, were very
eager to go forward without bidding: Having gained
this covered way, nothing could hold them; but they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56660:36"/>
went on very furouſly, and attack'd the Paliſſades of
the ſecond covered way, which they gained after a
ſhort diſpute, and the Enimies were in ſuch a Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that they ſoon abandoned them; all that their
Officers could do could not keep them up, but our Men
got in with them, and purſu'd them Sword in Hand, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all their Forts which they had upon the Brow of
this Hill, and ſo down to the very Counterſcarp of the
Tower before the <hi>Porte de Fer;</hi> the moſt forward went
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s far: But the reſt made a great Slaughter among the
<hi>French</hi> that had got into the Stone-pits, which are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
upon the ſide of this Hill, where they endeavoured in
the confuſion to conceal themſelves from the Fury of
our Soldiers: But the Forts made a conſiderable fire
and killed us many men, who were very thick all about
them. Where the <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards attack'd upon the Right,
the Enemies diſputed their Poſt very hard, and held
them to it: They were ſuſtained by my Lord <hi>George Ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>milton</hi>'s
firſt Battallion, who had his ſhare in the Honour
of the Action, though 'twas not this Regiment's turn to
mount the Trenches; but being at hand in the Line of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvallation,
my Lord received Orders to be ready with
his Regiment; Brigadier <hi>Fitz-Patrick</hi> marched at the
Head of it with his known Bravery: The <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards
(notwithſtanding the reſiſtance they met with) carried
the Paliſſades they attack'd, and the Royal Regiment
maintain'd it, and puſhed on with the reſt; and indeed
they all did wonders in this Attack: And when they
were once got in the firſt Paliſſades, there was no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of Battallions, but all mixed with one another,
and the Soldiers were very willing to obey their next Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
without diſtinction; ſo that I ſhall omit the due
praiſe which every Regiment deſerved upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as well the Regiments of the Trenches as the Guards,
ſome of which were concerned in the Attack, as the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiliers,
<hi>Tidcomb,</hi> &amp;c. The fire continued till paſt nine of
the Clock, and both the Regiments that mounted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
the Trenches remained to make good the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56660:36"/>
My Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> had the Trenches the night before,
with the Regiments of <hi>Tidcomb, Stanley,</hi> and <hi>Collingwood,</hi>
and did not diſmount till the whole Attack was over,
where he hazarded himſelf very freely, as he does up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occaſions of Service. Brigadier <hi>Fitz-patrick</hi> being to
mount the Trenches with the Regiments of <hi>Lauder, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goldesby,
Saunderſon,</hi> and <hi>Maitland,</hi> and Brigadier <hi>Friſheim,</hi>
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> relieved the Poſts which had been gained:
The Guards come off about mid-night, and marched
back to the Camp at <hi>Temploux,</hi> where they came very
early in the morning, after having gained a very great
Reputation in the Attack: For whereas they were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to to gain the outer covered way, by the diſpoſition of
the Attack; yet they beat the Enemies from all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments
they had upon this Hill, and purſued them
among their Forts, down the Hill to the very <hi>Porte de
Fer,</hi> where moſt of them were killed at the very Paliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade;
but ſeveral of our Men that had advanced ſo far,
were made Priſoners; among the reſt, Lieutenant-Colonels
<hi>Pierce</hi> and <hi>Morriſon,</hi> Captains of the ſecond
Regiment of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Guards, Enſign <hi>Atkins</hi> of the
ſame Regiment, and Enſign <hi>Roſs</hi> of the <hi>Scots</hi> Guards,
and ſeveral Soldiers. Major-General <hi>Ramſay,</hi> who
had the conduct of this Attack, had his Horſe woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
under him with a Musket-ſhot, and his Servant's
Horſe was killed juſt by him with a Cannon-ball,
which came very thick from the Caſtle, which fir'd
over the Town here. He had the thanks of the King for
this great Succeſs, who was preſent in the whole Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Compliments of the chief Generals; and
Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> writ him a Letter of Congratulation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occaſion.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did ſuch conſiderable Actions in this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack,
the <hi>Dutch</hi> were not idle upon the Left, but at the
ſame Signal with ours they marched out of their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and attacked the Left of the Enemies Retrenchments
towards the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> Major-General <hi>Saliſch</hi> commanded
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56660:37"/>
the Trenches, this night and the Attack of this ſide, with
the Regiments of the Trenches, and thoſe that were to
mount, in all 7 or 8 Battallions. The Enemies Fire was
more opiniatre of this ſide than it had been upon the
Right of our Attack; which cauſed a conſiderable ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
among the <hi>Dutch</hi> Regiments; but in ſpight of their
reſiſtance they gained the Work, and beat the Enemies
from their Renchments. The Regiments of <hi>Saliſch,</hi> and
another <hi>Dutch, Oxenſten,</hi> and <hi>Braha</hi> of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
very much in this Action; for which reaſon the
two firſt were ſent to Garriſon in <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and the two
laſt to <hi>Huy;</hi> and four other Pattallions were ſent from
<hi>Maeſtricht</hi> to take up their place in the Line of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvallation,
being the Regiments of <hi>Du Thiel, Anhalt

the Regiment of <hi>Saliſch</hi> was killed, and the Major wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with ſeveral other Officers killed and wounded, of
which I have not ſeen a particular account. As for our
own loſs, I ſhall here inſert as exact an account of it as

of the Grenadiers wounded. I have not ſeen the Liſt
of <hi>Lauder</hi>'s. As for our loſs among the Soldiers it was
generally computed, that we had in all in the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Dutch</hi> Attacks about 500 men killed, and about
1200 wounded; and that our whole Loſs, Officers,
and Soldiers put out of Battle, amounted to near
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56660:38"/>
1800 men at moſt, and this was the only aſſault where
we had any conſiderable loſs before the Town.</p>
                  <p>The Enemies had their choiceſt Troops for the defence
of theſe Retrenchments upon the Hill, and as ſoon as they
perceived that we deſigned an attack upon this place, they
ordered a great body of Foot and their beſt Dragoons to
march out of the Town, and to reinforce their Poſt upon the
Hill, we could ſee them march very eaſily from the King's
Quarter. So that (reinforcement and all) they had 8 or
9 Regiments of foot beſides Dragoons within the retrench<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments.
'Tis certain that we made a very great ſlaughter
among them, when once our Soldiers got in and purſued
them; they lay very thick in the pits, and up and down
their retrenchments; but becauſe the Beſieged always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
their loſſes as much as they can, we could not get a
perfect account of it; but 'tis very reaſonable to think
that their loſs was not much inferiour to ours. They

their Troops for a more neceſſary defence, and that they
had made a great ſlaughter amongſt us, having loſt 4 or
500 of their own. This was the account ſent to Court;
which we intercepted. I muſt not forget to ſpeak of a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
which the <hi>Bavarians</hi> made of two pieces of Cannon near
the <hi>Sambre</hi> againſt the end of the Enemies Line, and another
of the ſame number a little more to the left, which began

the Hill of <hi>Bouge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Evening of this Aſſault we began to mount four
Regiments of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and four <hi>Dutch,</hi> Major General
<hi>Saliſch</hi> and Brigadier <hi>Fits-Patrick,</hi> as we have ſaid before, had
the Trenches, the Kings Regiments were, <hi>Lauder, Ingoldes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
Sanderſon</hi> and <hi>Maitland:</hi> The ſame Evening more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
and Ammunitions came from <hi>Huy</hi> to the Camp
under the Eſcorte of the <hi>Heſſe</hi> Dragoons, Hitherto the
Artillery came up but leiſurely, and had as yet done but
little execution, and this night we ſecured our lodgments in
the Poſts we had gained. The 9th We had ſeveral Waggons
loaden with Spades, and Shovels, and other Inſtruments
to work in the ground, from <hi>Lovain.</hi> At night Major-General
<hi>Lindeboom</hi> had the Trenches, and my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> was
to mount, but Colonel <hi>Selwyn</hi> was declared Bigadier by his
Majeſty, who accordingly mounted the Trenches this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with the Regiments of <hi>Naſſau, Selwyn, Trelawne,</hi> and
<hi>Seymour.</hi> We worked to advance our Trenches towards the
deſcent of the Hill before St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> his gate, to embrace
the detached Baſtion the Enemies had here. The <hi>Dutch</hi>
upon the left, worked towards the <hi>Meuſe</hi> to bring their
Trench by the Jeſuits Houſe, under the Clifts which
hung over this River, upon which they worked at a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
to flank the ſide of the detached Baſtion. The <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgs</hi>
who had opened the Trench along the <hi>Meuſe</hi> above
the Caſtle the firſt Inſtant, had begun another the 5th, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the ſame River below the Town, which they had
now conſiderably advanced, in order to make two paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
lines all along the River, to cover the Batteries we
deſigned againſt St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> his gate, from the other ſide
of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and to bridle in the Enemies who were ſtill
maſters of the <hi>Fauxbourg de Jambe.</hi> The 10th Major-General
<hi>Heukelom</hi> had the Trenches, with my Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> and the
Regiments Royal, <hi>Columbine,</hi> Fuſiliers, and <hi>Tidcomb;</hi> and
this day the Regiments of <hi>Collingwood</hi> and <hi>Tidcomb</hi> had left
<hi>Temploux</hi> to go into the line of Circumvallation. The
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56660:39"/>
ſame day the <hi>Brandenbourghs</hi> having almoſt finiſhed their
parallel lines along the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the Enemies abandoned
the <hi>Fauxbourg de Jambe,</hi> and ſet it on fire, and retired to
the Baſtion upon the <hi>Meuſe</hi>-bridge. More Cannon and
Morters came up from <hi>Huy.</hi> The 11th. the reſt of the
King's Troops incamped at <hi>Temploux</hi> went into the line
of Circumvallation; the Brigade of Guards incamped at
the foot of the Hill below the King's quarter, near the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi>
and the reſt towards the Village <hi>de Bouge,</hi> at <hi>Maulx</hi>
and <hi>Bernacomen.</hi> Count <hi>Naſſau</hi> had his quarter at <hi>Berna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comen,</hi>
and Major-General <hi>Ramſay</hi> at <hi>Maulx.</hi> We had now
in all 78 Battalions before the Town in the whole line
of Circumvallation. The Prince of <hi>Tilly</hi> with the <hi>Leige</hi>
Forces was incamped of the <hi>Condros</hi> ſide of the <hi>Meuſe</hi>
to ſecure the Navigation of the river. At night Major-General
<hi>Ramſay</hi> commanded the Trenches, with Brigadier
<hi>Fits-Patrick,</hi> who were relieved by the Regiments of <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
Collingwood, Lauder,</hi> and <hi>Ingoldsby,</hi> As the Royal Regiment
march't out of the Trenches Major <hi>Macilvaine</hi> was killed
with a Cannon ball from the Caſtle, which beſides wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Enſign <hi>Loggins</hi> of <hi>Collingwoods</hi> Regiment, and three Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
His Majeſty declared my Lord <hi>George Hamilton</hi>
Brigadier in the Trenches. The ſame Evening we had a
Battery of three pieces of Cannon upon the riſing ground
of this ſide of the <hi>Sambre,</hi> which began to play upon the
Enemies poſted in the <hi>Ballance.</hi> The King was every
day in the Trenches from morning till night, and to
loſe no time had his dining Tent pitched near Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General
<hi>Tettau</hi>'s quarter at <hi>Bouge,</hi> to be juſt by the
Trenches. Several perſons were both killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
near the King in his dayly viſits of our approaches,
but it pleaſed God to ſpare his Sacred Perſon in all thoſe
dangers to which he ſo freely expoſed himſelf. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was generally accompanied by the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
my Lord <hi>Portland,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Soiſſons;</hi> and though
'twas contrary to orders, yet the Officers who followed
the King in the Trenches were too apt to crowd about
him, which made the King's going in the Trenches ſo much
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56660:39"/>
the more remarkable to the Enemies, and conſequently
dangerous.</p>
                  <p>The 12th we had finiſh'd a Pattery on the <hi>Brandenbourgh</hi>
ſide of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> juſt oppoſite to the Demy Baſtion of
St. <hi>Nicolas</hi> his Gate, and a round Tower, having only the
River between them, and this day it began to play. At
night Major-general <hi>Saliſch</hi> had the Trenches with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier
<hi>Selwyn,</hi> and the Regiments of <hi>Sanderſon, Maitland,
Naſſau,</hi> and <hi>Selwyn.</hi> The 13th. in the morning we had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
another Battery upon the River ſide in a Line with
the former, from both which the Cannon fired very fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
againſt the half Moon before St. <hi>Nicolas</hi> his Gate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Demy Baſtion of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and a thick ſtone <hi>Digue</hi>
or Damme which at this place keeps up the water in the
Foſſe of the Town. There was in all about 30 pieces of
Cannon upon theſe Batteries, beſides a Battery upon the
Hill of <hi>Bouge</hi> againſt the Enemies Forts upon the edge of
this Hill; another upon the deſcent of the Hill to flank the
detached Baſtion they had here, beſides a Battery of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to incommode the Enemy in their Works at St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas</hi>
his Gate where we were making our Approaches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
All theſe Batteries began this day to make a noiſe, which
before had done no great execution. The Town Wall was
weak along the <hi>Meuſe</hi> oppoſite to the left of our Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
for which reaſon the Enemies made within, paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
to the left of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> Battery, a blind of a great
heighth and thickneſs made up with Earth and Faſcines:
the reſt of the Batteries in this Line had its effect againſt
the old Tower and Works of whith we have now ſpoken.
At night Major-general <hi>Lindeboom</hi> mounted the Trenches
with my Lord <hi>George Hamilton</hi> Brigadier, and the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Trelawney, Seymour, Royal,</hi> and <hi>Columbine.</hi> The 14th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
early in the morning it began to rain very hard, which
laſted till Noon, the water filled all our Tenches, and
very much incommoded our Workmen; this likewiſe
cooled the Fire of our Batteries, which could not for this
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56660:40"/>
reaſon play as vigorouſly as the day before, but in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
it held up, and they made amends for the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Before this time the waters of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> were ſo
low that the Cannon came up with ſome difficulty from
<hi>Huy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> but thereafter we had no reaſon to complain of the
want of water, for the whole Summer following it rain'd
almoſt perpetually, and more rain has fallen this Seaſon,
than has been known for many years before. In the
Evening Major general <hi>Henkelem</hi> being fallen ſick, Major-general
<hi>Ramſay</hi> had the Trenches, which were relieved
by the Brigade of Guards commanded by my Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi>
whom his Majeſty declared this Campagne Brigadier of
the Guards, which is an Honour no Brigadier had enjoyed
before. My Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> his own Battallion of Guards remained
to do Duty at the King's Quarter, and the other four
mounted the Trenches. This night we puſhed our Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
down the Hill, and embraced the detach'd Baſtion
before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> St. <hi>Nicolas</hi> his Gate, for which reaſon the Officer
commanding this Baſtion demanded the next day (15) to
capitulate; he demanded liberty to go into the Town
with his men, which was refuſed him. Our Batteries
plaied the whole day with the ſame vigour they had done
the days before. In the afternoon our Bombs ſet on fire
the Church of St. <hi>Nicolas</hi> which joyns to the Gate of this
Name, where the Enemies had a Magazine, which did
them a conſiderable damage. In the Evening Major-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Saliſch</hi> and Brigadier <hi>Fits-Patrick</hi> mounted the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
with the Regiments of Fuſiliers, <hi>Tidcomb, Stanley,</hi>
and <hi>Collingwood.</hi> As the Trenches were relieving my
Lord <hi>Salkirk</hi> was dangerouſly wounded in the Head juſt
by the King, with a ſtone cauſed by the graſing of a
Cannon ball upon the top of the Trench. We applyed
the Miner to the detached Baſtion, and advanced our
Trenches clear to the bottom before St. <hi>Nicolas</hi> his
Gate. Which Work Brigadier <hi>Fits-Patrick</hi> very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by his preſence, his uſual vigilance carrying him
to ſee every thing done. In the morning early the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:56660:40"/>
that commanded in the detached Baſtion, fearing
the effect of our Mine, ſent his Lieutenant to offer to
Surrender it, who at firſt inſiſted upon the Capitulation
demanded the day before; but being threatned to be
blown up, he deſired liberty to go back and ſpeak to the
Captain, and that he would return immediately with a
further anſwer. Accordingly the Lieutenant returned,
and offered the detached Baſtion at diſcretion, and the
Captain marched out with two Lieutenants, an Ingenier,
and 53 men all of the <hi>Dauphins</hi> Regiment, and were ſent
Priſoners to <hi>Huy.</hi> They had a very good Caſematte in
the Baſtion, which covered them from our Bombs. At
night Najor-general <hi>Lindeboom,</hi> and Brigadier <hi>Selwyn,</hi> had
the Trenches, with <hi>Lauder, Ingoldesby, Sanderſon,</hi> and <hi>Mait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
Regi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nts. Captain <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Tidcombs</hi> was killed
diſmounting. We puſhed our Trenches far enough to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
the Counterſcarp the next day, and having gained
the detached Baſtion the day before, we worked at a
Battery at this foot of the Hill, to fire in front againſt
the Half-moon of St. <hi>Nicolas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having given an account of the progreſs of this Siege
thus far, I muſt return to ſpeak of our Affairs in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
We have left Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> incamped at <hi>Ghent</hi> without
<hi>Bruſſels</hi> Port the 15th, after he had made his glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
from the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi>'s numerous Army, and
Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſſis</hi> was ready with a detachment of 12
Battallions, and the Dragoons of <hi>Rouſſe</hi> and <hi>Cunningham</hi> to
march towards <hi>Newport:</hi> All Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi>'s Army
and Bagage being got through <hi>Ghent,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſſis</hi>
Lieutenant General repaſſed the next day (6) through
the Town, and marched till he came within 3 ſhort Leagues
of <hi>Bruges,</hi> upon the Enemeis ſide of the Canal, where he
incamped that night. The next day this Detachment not
being thought ſufficient for the ſecurity of <hi>Newport,</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> was ſent this way with 12 Battallions
more, and all the Dragoons of the Army. Major-generals
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56660:41"/>
                     <hi>Churchill</hi> and <hi>Mirmont</hi> and Brigadiers <hi>Erle</hi> and <hi>Haxhauſen,</hi> were
of the Detachment; and my Lord <hi>Rivers</hi> Major-general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Dragoons. Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> being obliged to
make ſuch Detachments for the ſafety of <hi>Flanders</hi> paſſed the
<hi>Scheld</hi> the day before (6) and incamped at <hi>Ooſtaker</hi> juſt
without <hi>Antwerp</hi> Port, with his right towards the <hi>Canal</hi>
of <hi>Saſvan Ghendt,</hi> his left by the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and <hi>Ghendt</hi>
before him. He had then but 26 Battallions left with
him, and about 30 Squadrons. The Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>
having been detached the 7th. from <hi>Ooſtaker</hi> marched that
day as far as <hi>Brug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

followed, and encamped pretty near this place upon the
<hi>Canal.</hi> That ſame day Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſſis,</hi> who had marched
with his 12 Battallions the day before within three Leagues
of <hi>Bruges,</hi> came very early to this place, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>lted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
the Soldiers, but the Dragoons marched on ſtreight to
<hi>Placendal,</hi> having paſt the <hi>Canal</hi> of <hi>Oftend</hi> at <hi>Bruges.</hi> The
Town provided bilanders for <hi>Tiffeny</hi>'s Regiment and all
the Grenadiers to go inceſſantly by water; they went of
by three of the Clock that afternoon; Colonel <hi>Tiffeny</hi>'s
Regiment remained to take poſt at <hi>Placendal,</hi> where the
<hi>Canal</hi> of <hi>Newport</hi> meets with that from <hi>Oſtend</hi> to <hi>Bruges;</hi>
but Colonel <hi>Southlandt,</hi> who commanded the Grenadiers,
went on by water to poſſeſs himſelf of the Paſs upon the
<hi>Canal</hi> of <hi>Newport</hi> at <hi>Laffine.</hi> That Evening Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſſis</hi>
marched with the reſt of the Foot all night t'other ſide
of the <hi>Canal</hi> of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> which he paſſed the next morning
to get to <hi>Placendal,</hi> where he halted again to refreſh the
Regiments, and went on upon the Sea ſide of the <hi>Canal</hi>
of <hi>Newport,</hi> and gained that day to <hi>Newendam</hi> Fort juſt by
<hi>Newport,</hi> where he incamped with all the Foot and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
under his Command, except <hi>Tiffeny</hi>'s Regiment
which continued to defend the Poſt of <hi>Placendal.</hi> And
Sir <hi>Henry Bellasſis</hi> being come to <hi>Newendam</hi> ſent the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of <hi>Strathnaver</hi> and <hi>George Hamilton</hi> to reinforce the

8th. and came to the <hi>Placendal,</hi> where he paſs'd
the Canal; and that ſame day the Foot came up, having
made two long Marches from <hi>Ghent</hi> hither. The 9th. the
Duke of <hi>Wirtemburgh</hi> paſs'd the Canal at <hi>Placendal,</hi> and
advanced with the Foot and Dragoons as far as <hi>Newport,</hi>

                  <p>The Marechal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> (as we have ſaid it above)

Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſis</hi> were detach'd ſo a <hi>Propos</hi> by Prince
<hi>Vaudemont;</hi> and they made ſuch diligence towards this
place, that they prevented their Deſign: And the
Marechal <hi>Villeroy</hi> continued in his Camp between <hi>Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelar</hi>
and <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> to expect freſh Orders from the
Court. The 11th. The Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> being too
far from Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> to be ready to joyn him, if
<hi>Villeroy</hi> ſhould march towards <hi>Brabant,</hi> thought it beſt to
leave a good Garriſon in <hi>Newport,</hi> and to come back
nearer to <hi>Oſtend;</hi> for which Reaſon he march'd, and
encamp'd this day under the Walls of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
all the Sluices to drown all the Country about
<hi>Newport.</hi> The 12th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on through <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and paſs'd the Harbour upon a
Bridge of Boats made for that purpoſe, and encamp'd

paſs'd the Canal, for the Guard both of the Canal, of

The Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> continued encamp'd here ſome

as for the Garriſon that was in it, which being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for us to relieve, they were ſure to have them
Priſoners; which would prove a great prejudice to us
and to our Affairs to have ſo many Regiments out
of Service. And though it was plain, that this
place could not be kept; yet, conſidering that we
had no Frontier for <hi>Ghent</hi> and <hi>Bruges,</hi> which are great
places, and capable of no defence, 'twas very much our
Intereſt to maintain not only <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> but <hi>Deinſe,</hi> as

Monſieur <hi>de Montal</hi> had Orders to inveſt <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi>
whilſt <hi>Villeroy</hi> continued encamped near this place to
make good the Siege; for though they did not expect ſo
cheap a Bargain as they had of this place, yet they
were reſolved to make the Garriſon Priſoners of
War; and <hi>Montal</hi> had Orders from the <hi>French</hi> King
to give no other Conditions; for which reaſon the
Marechal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> kept with his Army pretty near
<hi>Dixmuyde</hi> to oblige the Beſieged to come to theſe
Conditions, having given <hi>Montal</hi> a conſiderable Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement

Trenches very near the Glacis, particularly before the

the loſs of the Town after it, which could not then
reſiſt above four hours: That the Enemies had made
conſiderable Approaches before <hi>Furnes</hi> Port, to attack
the Ravelin that covers the Bridge; and that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

               <p>Theſe are the Articles upon which the Garriſon of

ſhould rather be undervalued for it) are ſuch as any
Regiment could have in the open Field, and which ſome
Regiments actually had in the very Plains of <hi>Fleury,</hi>
after the loſs of that Battle; where being form'd into
ſquare Battallions, and reſolved otherwiſe to defend
themſelves, they had the Terms of Priſoners of War
given them, though ſurrounded with the Enemies Horſe.
This Treatment ſurpriz'd very much all the Officers and
Soldiers of the Garriſon, who had hitherto been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Honourable Terms, to march out of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with their Arms: they conceived ſuch indignation
at the news of it, that ſeveral Soldiers broke their
Arms to pieces, even before the Enemy, and wiſhed,
that ſince they were made Priſoners of War, they had
ſold their Liberty to the <hi>French</hi> as dear as poſſibly they
could, by a vigorous reſiſtance. As ſoon as the Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was ſign'd, the <hi>French</hi> took poſſeſſion of the <hi>Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelar</hi>
Port, and were really Maſters of the place, before
a great part of the Garriſon knew any thing of the
ſigning a Capitulation; and the <hi>French</hi> Soldiers crowded
in the place before it had been evacuated by our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.
According to the Capitulation, the Regiments
drew out in Battallion, and marched clear off their
Arms, which they left with their Colours, except my
Lord <hi>Lorne</hi>'s Regiment, which tore off the Colours from
the Staff, rather than ſuffer them to be a Trophy to
the Enemy. A great many Soldiers had broke their
Arms to pieces, and the reſt the <hi>French</hi> took poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of, and ſent the Colours taken to be put up in
<hi>Noſtre Dame</hi>'s Church in <hi>Paris.</hi> The Garriſon was at firſt
ſent to <hi>Ipre,</hi> but was afterwards diſpoſed, without any
regard to the Capitulation, in ſeveral Towns in the
<hi>Pays Conquis:</hi> Some to <hi>Arras,</hi> others to <hi>Bethune, Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chain,
Cambray,</hi> and <hi>Doway:</hi> And whereas it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
agreed in the Articles, That no Soldiers ſhould
be ſent Priſoners into any Town without the <hi>Pays Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis</hi>
ſince the Year 1672<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they were ſent to <hi>Arras</hi>

that, and ſome as far as <hi>Bethune</hi> in the Borders of
<hi>Picardy:</hi> But this is not the only Article in which the
<hi>French</hi> violated the publick Faith of Capitulations. There
is hardly one which they obſerved; they would not in
ſeveral places ſuffer the Officers to come near the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers

the taking of <hi>Namur,</hi> they put the Officers in cloſe
impriſonment: And whereas by the Cartel, all Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are reclaimable within a Fortnight after they are
taken, and that 'twas expreſly capitulated, the Garriſon

thus detained Priſoners contrary to the Capitulation,
they perſecuted and oppreſſed them to make them
take on with the late King's Officers; by which means
a great many Soldiers have been forced away from
our Service; and, I dare ſay, as many, as could have

notwithſtanding that the pretext to capitulate was
for the pretended ſafety and preſervation of the Regiments
in a place not tenable againſt the Enemies Power: yet
it has been this very Capitulation which has ruined
and ſpoiled ſeveral fine and good Regiments, and has
rendred ſome almoſt incapable of doing the King any
Service for ſome time. I wiſh for my part that I could
have been ſilent in this Matter, and that I could
(like the Painter) have drawn a Curtain over this Spot

then advanced near to <hi>Binche,</hi> and incamped at <hi>Herlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont-Capelle,</hi>
near to <hi>Marimont;</hi> from whence, the 11th.
he detached the Count <hi>de Lippe</hi> Brigadier, with ſixteen
Squadrons of Horſe, to march towards the Enemies
Line at <hi>Givry</hi> between <hi>Mons</hi> and the <hi>Sambre,</hi> to raiſe
Contributions. At his return he halted near <hi>Binch,</hi>
an old Town between <hi>Mons</hi> and the <hi>Sambre,</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
Walls about it. The <hi>French</hi> make a Winter

made about 500 Men, commanded by Colonel <hi>Colling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</hi>
Major-General <hi>Ramſay</hi> mounted the Trenches

for the occaſion. The Attack began about
five of the Clock in the Afternoon by the Grenadiers,
who went on very couragiouſly to the Glacis, and
fir'd their Grenades over the Paliſſades in the cover'd
way. The Enemies had traverſes paliſſaded all along
this cover'd way, from the <hi>Porte de Fer</hi> to the <hi>Meuſe,</hi>
which added very much to the defence of the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp.

But the Enemies, under the cover of their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes,

they came to lodge the Wooll-ſacks and Gabions upon
the Paliſſades of the Glacis, the Enemies, who ſtill defended

fire, and ſprang two or three Fougaces or little Mines,
which did ſome damage. Several Grenadiers leap'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

at a time when they muſt fire with a great deal of Art

in their Trenches, who behav'd themſelves with
the ſame Pravery as ours had done upon the Right.
Baron <hi>de Hasfert</hi> Colonel of a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Regiment was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Drakes or Fauconners they had, which they fir'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
down upon our Trenches in the bottom, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Major General <hi>Saliſch</hi> and my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> mounted the
Trenches with the Brigade of Guards. The Battallion
of <hi>Scots</hi> Guards did Duty at the King's Quarter. In
the dusk of the Evening we fir'd all our Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery

by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the <hi>Allies;</hi> all the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
being drawn out about the Line of Circumval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

play'd very hard to make a Breach upon the Left of

Detachment lay all night upon their Arms at the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance</hi>
to be ready to fall on in the morning: The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who foreſaw they could not keep their Line
whilſt we could attack them within, drew away
their Cannon from it this night. Major-General <hi>Linde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deboom</hi>
mounted the Trenches with Brigad er <hi>Fitz-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,</hi>
and the Regiments of <hi>Columbine,</hi> Fuſiliers, <hi>Tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb</hi>
and <hi>Stanley.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> upon the Left had puſh'd
their Trenches to the <hi>Meuſe</hi> along the Paliſſades of the
covered way; and this night they made ſome Traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
along the narrow Beach under the bank of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
before the point of the Demy Baſtion of the

               <p>The 20th. early in the morning (being then rainy

to attack the Line in Front, the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Bavarians</hi>
upon the left of the Gate, and the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi>'s upon
the right. The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was preſent in the
whole Attack. A conſiderable Detachment of about 1000
Horſe and Dragoons was poſted between the <hi>Ballance</hi> and
the Abbey of <hi>Salſen,</hi> to hinder the Enemies from ſally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d them pretty well from the Enemies
Cannon-ſhot. Major General <hi>Suerin</hi> commanded the <hi>Dutch</hi>
at the Attack in front of the Line upon the left of the
Gate, where the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Battery of 7 pieces of Cannon
had began to ſpoil the parapet. The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Bavarians</hi>
march'd up from the <hi>Ballance</hi> in ſeveral Lines, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on the left Flank with a good Body of Horſe and
Dragoons towards the <hi>Cohorn,</hi> of which we have
now ſpoken. When they came up, the Enemies
did not long diſpute their two Traverſes they had made
within the Line, but retired to the perpendicular Line of
Communication between the Line and the <hi>Caſotte:</hi> This
gave Major-General <hi>Swerin</hi> opportunity to get over the
Line at his Attack, and ſo to joyn and fall upon the
Enemies in this Retrenchment of Communication. The
<hi>Brandenburghs</hi> at the ſame time kept the Enemies employ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d
upon the right of the Line towards the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> ſo that
they could not ſo well defend this Communication, which
they were forced at laſt to yield, and the whole Line,
being near an <hi>Engliſh</hi> half Mile in length, and a prodigious
Work cut into the very Rock, which coſt the Enemies a
vaſt deal of Money and Labour: We gain'd this hardly
without any loſs not having as yet above 20 men kill'd and
wounded. The Enemies had a Battery of 2 pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
upon the deſcent of the Hill of <hi>Cohorn</hi> towards <hi>Salſen,</hi>
300 men were detached out of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Troops to
force the Enemies from this Battery, which they diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a little, but when they abandon'd it to retire in
the <hi>Cohorn,</hi> we found that they had before ſent off the
two pieces of Cannon. A <hi>Dutch</hi> Battallion, with ſome

                  <hi>Bavarian</hi> Dragoons ſuſtained the 30) men detach'd, who
having forced the Enemy from the Battery, purſued
them to the covered way of the <hi>Cohorn,</hi> where they
went, as if they had been to make themſelves Maſters of
the Work, but a great many paid for their raſhneſs, and
periſhed near the upper point of the covered way of the
<hi>Cohorn.</hi> After we had gain'd the Enemies Line, we
work'd to make a Lodgment within the Line-parallel
to the covered way of the <hi>Caſotte,</hi> which took up all
the top of the Hill between the two Rivers. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
diſputed the Lodgment very hard, making a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
ſire from the covered wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and with the Cannon they had in this place; but
we at laſt finiſhed it, which continued in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
till we beſieged the Caſtle; the Guardbeing
relieved daily at this Poſt by a Brigadier and four or
five Regiments. 'Twas in making of this Lodgment,
and before the Cohorn that we loſt moſt Men, which
amounted to about 300 men killed and wounded. A
Captain of the Elector's Guards was killed; one of the
Elector's Ingeniers, and one of his Gentlemen wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
I have not heard of any other Officers of note.
Thus we took this mighty Work deſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to render the
Caſtle impregnable, and which would indeed have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the attacking of the Caſtle very difficult if it had
been continued down the Hill to the <hi>Ballance</hi> upon the
<hi>Sambre;</hi> for this Paſſage being once gain'd, the Line can
be attac'd within, which renders it weak and not defenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And ſince we have made our ſelves Maſters of <hi>Namur,</hi>
we have work'd to produce this Line down the Hill to the
<hi>Ballance</hi> to fortifie this Paſs of the <hi>Sambre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame day (20.) we ſprung a Mine under the
<hi>Digue</hi> to blow it up, to let the Water (by the ruining
of this Work) out of the <hi>Foſſé;</hi> but being juſt upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
ſo that we could not get under the Foundation, and the
Stone-work being very hard; it could not have any axtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary

<hi>Digue</hi> was beat down, and the Water was considerably ſunk
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56660:52"/>
in the <hi>Foſſé.</hi> The King had this Day the unfortunate

the Line to be employ'd in the Siege. One of our
Bombs fell into a Magazine of Grenades the Enemies had
upon the old Wall, between the old Tower and St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>'s
Gate; the Bomb blew up the Grenades, and put
them on fire, which made ſuch a noiſe that the Enemies
within thought it had been an Aſſault, and drew out to
the Gate as faſt as they could to defend the place. At
Night Major-General <hi>Lindeboom</hi> had the Trenches, and
my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> with the Brigade of Guards, the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Guards excepted, who did Duty at the King's Quarter.
The 23d. early in the Morning a Battery of 18 pieces of
Cannon of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Artillery began to play very vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
upon the Face of the Baſtion of St. <hi>Roch</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s his Gate, and ſoon beat down all
the Stone-work of it; but the Enemies were ſtill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the cover'd way upon the right of the point
of this Baſtion towards the <hi>Porte de Fer;</hi> ſo that it was
neceſſary in order to make afterwards an Attack upon
the Breach to extend our Lodgment upon the cover'd
way to the right of this Baſtion, and conſequently
to make another Aſſault to drive the Enemies out of the
Traverſes they had in this cover'd way, of which they were
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56660:53"/>

but little before Sun-ſet, and the Diſpute laſted ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
late in the night. Our Cannon and Mortars made a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
noiſe, and the Small-ſhot went on very briskly for
a great while. The Enemies diſputed their Lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
very long and very well, where ſome of their
Officers ſignalized themſelves very much, paticularly one,
who ſtood a great while upon the very Paliſſades, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to all the Fire of our Cannon, encouraging his
Men, and waving his Hat over his Head: The Earth
torn up by the grazing of our Cannon-balls covered him
twice or thrice, and when our Officers, who admir'd his
Bravery, expected him to be knock'd on the Head, he
ſtill got up again: However, in ſpight of the Enemies
reſiſtance we extended our Lodgment conſiderably up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Right. My Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> who commanded the
Brigade of Guards In the Trenches this day, had
Captain <hi>Wentworth</hi> Lieutenant of the Second Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Guards (who waited upon his Lordſhip to
carry his Orders to the Brigade) killed with a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ball

The Dutch Granadiers marched on very bravely over the
<hi>Digue,</hi> though it was but narrow, and conſequently a very
diſadvantagious Defilé to attack a Breach; nevertheleſs they
carried it, and lodged themſelves upon the Demi-Baſtion,
of which they continued Maſters for above an hour; but
the Demi-Baſtion being narrow, and the Granadiers crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon it, the Enemy ſo pelted them with Granado's from
the old Wall within, that they were forced to abandon it,
and to Lodge themſelves without, at the foot of the Baſtion,
and though 'twas dark night yet the Artillery ſtill fired
very hard to diſturb the Enemies, to facilitate our Aſſault,
which was the reaſon that ſometimes our own Cannon did
us harm; however, our Loſs was not anſwerable to the
terribleneſs of the noiſe in the Attack. We had in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade
of Guards but nine Men killed, and thirteen wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and I ſuppoſe our Loſs was proportionable in the other
Regiments. In the firſt Regiment of Engliſh Guards,
Captain <hi>Cripeny</hi> and Enſign <hi>Shute</hi> were wounded: in the
Royal Regiment, Lieutenant <hi>Archibald Hamilton,</hi> wounded;
in <hi>Selwyn</hi>'s, Lieutenants <hi>Caſtles,</hi> and <hi>Corbonnel</hi> killed: In

and did not return to his Quarters till after Mid-night. The

now that our I odgment upon the Conterſcarp was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
extended for an Aſſault; all the other Batteries played
with the ſame vigour, and the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi>'s particularly,
to make the Breach of the Demi-Baſtion more eaſie, and
to Ruine the Half Moon of St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi> The Bridge of
Communication between this Half Moon and the Curtain
was quite broke to pieces, ſo that the Enemies could no more
Relieve it. But when we expected yet another Aſſault upon

which all the Batteries were immediately ordered to be

<hi>Scots</hi> Guards, who waited upon Major-General <hi>Ramſay</hi>
in the Trenches, was ſent to the Breach to know what
Count <hi>Guiſcard</hi> deſired, who asked to ſpeak with Major-General
<hi>Ramſay;</hi> Whereupon the Major-General went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and after uſual Civilities on both ſides, the Count <hi>de
Guiſcard</hi> told him, That though the Neceſſity and Condition
of their Affairs was not ſuch as to oblige them to Capitulate,
yet for the Preſervation of the Town, they were willing to
give it up upon Honourable Terms, and deſired that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages
might be exchanged, to enter upon the terms of the
Capitulation. Major-General <hi>Ramſay</hi> told him, That he
would acquaint the Duke of <hi>Holſtein-Ploen</hi> with it, whoſe
Quarter was juſt by; and that he ſhould have his Anſwer
in an hour. The word of Honour being given on both ſides
for a Ceſſation of Arms, during the time, Major-General
<hi>Ramſay</hi> went himſelf to the Duke of <hi>Holſtein-Ploen,</hi> and from
thence to the King, who Dined this day at his own Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
being come very late from the Attack the over night,
and ſo could not be in the Trenches the next Morning.
His Majeſty ſent the Major-General back to the Trenches,

to Commiſſion a Perſon to Treat with Count <hi>Guiſcard</hi> for

               <p>The Evening after the Capitulation ſign'd, Colonel
<hi>Lauder</hi> took Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Porte de Fer,</hi> with 500 Men,
as 'tis agreed upon in the Eighth Article, putting a Guard
in the inner Gate, in a Line oppoſite to the Guard of the
Beſieged. His Majeſty was preſent, and the French Officers
crowded very much upon the Rampart to ſee the King, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill where the King was, and which was the King?
After we had Poſſeſſion of this Gate, we began to draw off
our Batteries, and the Day following, in the Morning,
the Garriſon of the Redoubts of St. <hi>Fiacre,</hi> St. <hi>Anthony,</hi>
and <hi>Pieanoir;</hi> the two firſt upon the ſide of the Hill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Town, between St. <hi>Nicolas</hi>'s Gate, and the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56660:56"/>
                  <hi>Porte de Fer,</hi> and the laſt at the Foot of the Hill, before
the <hi>Porte de Fer,</hi> covering the Sluyce of the Brook of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derin,</hi>
which runs in the <hi>Foſſè</hi> at this Place. We found
their Falconnets in theſe Forts, which had ſo gall'd us in
our Trenches before the Counterſcarp; one was of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth's Reign, with his Artillery Deviſe upon
it, <hi>Ratio ultima regum.</hi> As ſoon as the Capitulation was
ſign'd. Count <hi>de Naſſu-weilbourg</hi> Major-General, was
detach'd with about 22 Squadrons of Horſe towards
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> to join and re-inforce Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi>'s Army.
The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> nam'd the Count <hi>de Brouay</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Namur,</hi> till ſuch a time as the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
ſhould approve of him, or appoint another: this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with that of <hi>Mons,</hi> the Citadels of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and
<hi>Ghendt,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> being always reſerv'd
to the King's own Nomination; the reſt is at the Choice
of the Governours of the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> The 27th. the
Count <hi>de Brouay,</hi> Governour of <hi>Namur,</hi> and Sergeant-General
<hi>de Bataille,</hi> took Poſſeſſion of the Place, with Six
Dutch Regiments, after the <hi>French</hi> had withdrawn into
the Caſtle. The Town was not much endammag'd by
the Siege; that Street only which leads to St. <hi>Nicolas</hi>'s
Gate being batter'd by our Cannon and Bombs, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impoſſible to fire 'em ſo juſtly always, but that ſome
muſt get into the Town; however, we avoided it as much
as we could: And as for the Condition of the Breaches,
they were ſuch, that the Beſieged could yet have ſuſtain'd
another Aſſault; for the Breach of the Baſtion of St. <hi>Roch</hi>
was not yet ſufficiently applaniſh'd to attack it, and if it
had been carried by Aſſault, the Beſieged had ſtill a Foſſe,
and an old Wall within, beſides the Retrenchment they had
made within the old Wall, to make their Capitulation. But
I believe, the Truth is, they had loſt ſo many Men in the
defence of the Town, that the Maréchal <hi>de Bouflers,</hi> and
Count <hi>de Guiſcard,</hi> thought it convenient to reſerve the
reſt for the more neceſſary defence of the Caſtle, and its
ſtrong Appendencies, where they expected a certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and therefore they would provide for a good Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56660:57"/>
there to expect it. The Garriſon marched into the
Caſtle 7000 effective Men, having loſt about 5000. in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Defence of the Town, killed, wounded, and deſerted;
of the laſt there were a great many, and particularly the
day that they evacuated the Town ſeveral hundreds hid
themſelves in the Inhabitants Cellars, and others got over
the Walls near the Gate we had in Poſſeſſion. The <hi>French,</hi>
in quitting this place, broke the Bridge over the <hi>Sambre</hi>
that leads to the Caſtle, and pulled down all the Houſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the <hi>Sambre</hi> oppoſite to the Town, to make a good
Breaſt-Work againſt it.</p>
               <p>The ſame day we took Poſſeſſion of the Town
Count <hi>Naſſau</hi> Lieutenant-General, with Major-Generals
<hi>Ramſay, Salisch,</hi> and <hi>Heukelom,</hi> Brigadiers <hi>Fitzpatrick, Selwyn,</hi>

Thirteen of theſe Battalions were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſeventeen

The Engliſh having left a Horſe, a Company as before, to

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56660:57"/>
of the Siege of <hi>Namur:</hi> From thence, when the Town Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulated,
he marched to this Camp of <hi>Libercey,</hi> in order to
advance towards Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi>'s Army. The ſame Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we came to <hi>Genap,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> came up to us, and
took the Command of the Army: he brought along with him
80. Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons, ſo that we had now
beſide the 30. Battalions, 112. Squadrons. The Cavalry En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
higher up the <hi>Dyle</hi> before the Foot, and the Foot
with the right at <hi>Genap,</hi> and left toward the Abbey of <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers-Perwys,</hi>
with the Cauſey that goes to <hi>Namur</hi> before them.
The 30th. my Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> took his Quarter in <hi>Genap,</hi> and
we halted to obſerve the motions of the Maréchal <hi>de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy,</hi>
who was now advanced as far as <hi>Enghien,</hi> in order to
march back, and take the Poſt of <hi>Maſy,</hi> if <hi>Villeroy</hi> ſhould
march on to <hi>Nivelle:</hi> or elſe to be ready to joyn Prince
<hi>Vaudemont,</hi> if <hi>Villeroy</hi> ſhould make towards <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> In
order to this, Lieutenant General <hi>du Puy,</hi> was Detach'd
with 1000. Horſe to obſerve the motions of the Enemy,
(the 30th.) and to ſecure the ſtrong Paſs of <hi>Braine le Chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>au,</hi>
if we ſhould be obliged to march nearer to <hi>Bruſſels:</hi>
by which the French could otherwiſe cut off the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
between us and the Prince, and have hindred us
from Incamping at <hi>Braine-Alleu,</hi> and <hi>Waterlo.</hi> This brings
me back from the Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> to ſpeak of our Affairs in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and of the motions of Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> and the
Enemy's Army.</p>
               <p>We have left Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> Encamped at <hi>Ooſtackre,</hi>
without <hi>Antwerp-Porte</hi> at <hi>Ghendt,</hi> between the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and
the Canal of <hi>Saſvan-Ghendt,</hi> with 18. Battalions, (including

and 22. Squadrons of Engliſh Horſe, and 7. Dutch,
all the Dragoons were with the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> near

ſince the taking of <hi>Deinſe,</hi> near <hi>Ghendt,</hi> with his Right at

five or ſix days; but before we attend his Army
from hence to <hi>Brabant,</hi> we muſt not forget the Barbarities
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56660:58"/>
and Inhumanities which the French Soldiers Committed
in this Deſolate Country which was all at their devotion,
of the French ſide of the Canal of <hi>Bruges:</hi> They Plundred
all the Inhabitants, and ſtripp'd a great many naked; and
not only the Villages and Country People felt the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Uſage of the Soldiers, but the Churches and Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;
and nothing, though never ſo Sacred and Holy,
could eſcape their Sacrilegious Hands. They ſtole all the
Chalices that they could find either in Churches or Prieſts
Houſes, without any regard to their God and Saviour,
whom they pretend to be in it; and Robbed the Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated
Sacrament of his Dwelling and Habitation. At
<hi>Torhout,</hi> a conſiderable Borough, they Ruined the Place,
Plundered the Inhabitants, ſtripping the beſt of them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
and their beaſtly Fury carried them to the very Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
Raviſhing, without diſtinction, the Nuns, as well
as other Women: And yet theſe are the Men whom the
French pretend to be the only Defenders of the Catholick
Cauſe; as if the Emperor, and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> were the
greateſt Betrayers of this Intereſt, by their Alliance with
the King, and the States of <hi>Holland.</hi> Whereas, not only
thoſe whom they brand with the name of Hereticks, but
the very Turks and Barbarians would ſcarce be guilty of
ſo much diſreſpect to their Holy Places. This is a ſhort
Account of the crying Miſchiefs the Enemies committed in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> whilſt it was expoſed to the Licentious Fury of
their Soldiers; and no doubt, they could have done more;
they could have Crown'd this Maſter-piece of Cruelty
by the Bombarding of <hi>Ghendt,</hi> and <hi>Bruges,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi>
King thought it would make more noiſe in the World,
and more Miſchief in the Spaniſh Netherlands to Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard
its Metropolis, the Seat of its Governors, its chief
place of Wealth and Trade, and the dwelling of the
Court, and of its chiefeſt Nobility; and then afterwards
to Raiſe the Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> and command, or give
(as they term it) Peace to <hi>Europe.</hi> 'Tis in the purſuit of
this important Attempt, that we muſt now follow <hi>Villeroy</hi>
and his Army. Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> having Intelligence of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56660:58"/>
the Enemy's Deſigns to paſs the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and march towards
<hi>Brabant,</hi> drew Sir <hi>David Collier</hi> with his eight Battalions,
from the Guard of the Canal of <hi>Bruges,</hi> and the Dragoons
from the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>'s Army, who joyn'd him

the <hi>Lys</hi> at <hi>Wacken,</hi> and Incamped near the <hi>Scheld</hi> within
the Line. Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> having notice of this Motion
of the Enemies, decamped the ſame day from <hi>Ooſtackre,</hi>
having then 26 Battalions with him, and all the Engliſh
Horſe and Dragoons, (except the Dragoons of <hi>Roſſe</hi> and
<hi>Cunningham,</hi> which remained with Lieutenant-General <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſis,</hi>
and thoſe which went with the King, of which we

paſſed the <hi>Scheld</hi> this day about a League above <hi>Dendermond,</hi>
upon a Bridge of Boats with the Foot, which Encamped

had information that <hi>Villeroy</hi> was re paſſing the <hi>Lys,</hi> which

day before only to ſend him towards <hi>Brabant,</hi> and in the

to put the <hi>Paijs de Waes</hi> under Contribution, for which

he received a more certain Account of <hi>Villeroy's</hi> Motions,
that he was then paſſing the <hi>Scheld</hi> to march towards <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant;</hi>
the Prince then cauſed the Columnes of the March
to Face to the Right-about, and march back towards the
<hi>Scheld,</hi> where the Horſe and Foot paſſed as they had done
the day before, and ſo went with all ſpeed towards <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi>
having then a good Account of <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Orders and
Deſigns: The Army marched the whole night, except a
halt it made of two or three hours about the middle of
the night; but the Baggage ſtill continued loaded, and the
Soldiers reſted upon their Arms. The halt being over, the
Army march'd on towards the Canal of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56660:59"/>
it paſs'd the next Day, the Foot at <hi>Vilvorde,</hi> and the Horſe
at <hi>Burnt</hi> Bridge, and ſo gain'd that Evening being the 28th.
the Camp of <hi>Deghem,</hi> having march'd two Days and one
Night about Thirty ſix Hours; and notwithſtanding the
feeble and valetudinary Diſpoſition of the Prince, yet in
ſo long a March he was very often on Horſeback, taking
care of every thing; his Zeal for the Cauſe, and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for the Service, overcoming all the Infirmities of his
Body, which ſeem'd to make prodigious Efforts to execute
the wiſe Orders of his Mind. By this great March he
gain'd the Advantage of the Enemy to get between them
and <hi>Namur,</hi> tho' he could not hinder the Bombarding of
<hi>Bruſſels.</hi> At the ſame time that Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> left the
Camp of <hi>Ooſtackre</hi> to march towards <hi>Derdermond,</hi> the Duke
of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> left the Neighbourhood of <hi>Bruges,</hi> to follow
the Prince with all ſpeed, in order to join him with the
12 Battalions under his Command, and march'd the ſame
Day (being the 26th.) to <hi>Ghendt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Villeroy,</hi> who had paſs'd the <hi>Scheld</hi> the ſame Day at <hi>Eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naffe</hi>
march'd with his whole Army to <hi>Leſſines</hi> upon the
River <hi>Dender</hi> below <hi>Aeth,</hi> which being a conſiderable
March to paſs the <hi>Scheld</hi> and advance thus far, oblig'd
him to halt the next Day, and to ſtay till all the Artillery,
Baggage, and Stragglers, were come up. <hi>Montal</hi> was left
in the Lines with no more Men than was juſt neceſſary to
do the Duty of a Guard upon them. Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſis,</hi>
who encamp'd at <hi>Placendal,</hi> whilſt the Duke of <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
was at <hi>Bruges,</hi> came up to this Place upon the Duke's
marching to <hi>Ghendt;</hi> and the Regiments of <hi>Tiffany</hi> and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi>
were detach'd from his Body to re-inforce Prince <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demont</hi>'s
Army; ſo that Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſis</hi> had at <hi>Bruges</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Command, 10 Battalions and 2 Regiments of
Dragoons, having drawn off the Regiments of <hi>Strathna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
and <hi>George Hamilton,</hi> from <hi>Newport,</hi> and <hi>Belcaſtell</hi> from
<hi>Oſtend.</hi> The 29th. Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> march'd through
<hi>Bruſſels</hi> from <hi>Deghem,</hi> and encamp'd without <hi>Halleporte</hi>
and Fort <hi>de Monterey,</hi> with his Right upon the Hill that lies
juſt over the River <hi>Senne</hi> and his Left at the <hi>Namur</hi> Port;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56660:59"/>
where he immediately order'd the Army to retrench and
fortifie this Riſing Ground, which was very ſtrong, and
where it had been very difficult for <hi>Villeroy</hi> to have forc'd,
even this ſmall Army: The high Ground near the <hi>Senne,</hi>
this River and the Fort <hi>de Monterey,</hi> fortified his Right;
beſides the Retrenchments in the Front, it was cover'd by
the <hi>Bois de Sogne,</hi> which came up cloſe to the Left, and
<hi>Bruſſels</hi> remain'd juſt in the Rear. Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> could
have taken the Camp of <hi>Anderleck,</hi> where he could (being
join'd by my Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> and Count <hi>Naſſau</hi>) have
prevented the Bombarding of <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> but then the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
would have had the Advantage of us in marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Namur:</hi> ſo that it was impoſſible at the ſame time
to cover the Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> and to prevent the Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barding
of this Place. The Foot only of Prince <hi>Vaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>'s
Army encamp'd within the Retrenchment, between
<hi>Halle Porté,</hi> and that of <hi>Namur;</hi> the Cavalry and Dragoons
being re-inforc'd with the 22 Squadrons detach'd from the
Siege of <hi>Namur</hi> with Count <hi>Naſſau Weilbourg,</hi> encamp'd
at <hi>Scarbeck,</hi> between <hi>Deghem</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> to guard the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of the Canal, being commanded by Monſieur <hi>D' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verquerque.</hi>
But Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> being extreamly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigu'd
with the long March to <hi>Deghem</hi> was forc'd to keep
his Bed at <hi>Bruſſels.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Villeroy,</hi> who halted the 28th. at <hi>Leſſines,</hi> for all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

<hi>Mons,</hi> paſs'd the <hi>Dender</hi> at <hi>Leſſines,</hi> and encamp'd with

which was eſcorted by the Marquis <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> who had
paſs'd the <hi>Sambre</hi> ſome days before, to join and re-inforce
the Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy.</hi> My Lord of <hi>Athlone,</hi> with the
Horſe and Count <hi>Naſſau,</hi> with the Foot, whom we
have brought to the Camp of <hi>Genap</hi> the 29th. halted
here the next day: The Enemies being then at <hi>Enghien</hi>
and <hi>Steinkirk,</hi> we had not one Piece of Cannon; and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56660:60"/>
we were very much afraid, that <hi>Villeroy,</hi> inſtead of going
to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> ſhould have march'd to <hi>Nivelle;</hi> for then we
muſt have retreated from <hi>Genap,</hi> (which is but a League
from <hi>Nivelle</hi>) to the Camp of <hi>Maſy:</hi> And Prince <hi>Vaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
being encamp'd at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the Enemies from <hi>Nivelle</hi>

<hi>Genap;</hi> ſo that he muſt have march'd about by <hi>Louvain,</hi>
to come to <hi>Namur,</hi> which conſequently would have given
the Enemies the Advantage of a March for the Relief of
the Siege: But <hi>Villeroy</hi> had Orders to Bombard <hi>Bruſſels,</hi>
and he muſt execute them; which has loſt the French the
beſt opportunity they could have to relieve the Siege of
<hi>Namur.</hi> The 30th. Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> was re-inforc'd by
the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> who came up to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> this Day
with the 12 Battalions under his Command, and encamp'd
within the Retrenchment between the Gates of <hi>Halle</hi> and
<hi>Namur,</hi> where we had now, by this junction, 38 Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions:
And this is the mighty Army in whoſe preſence
<hi>Villeroy</hi> bombarded <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> which (as the <hi>Paris</hi> Gazetteer
boaſted) dar'd not attack the French Army, which ſought,
by this undertaking, an occaſion of fighting, and to bring
us to a Battel.</p>
               <p>The French being now Maſters of all the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

March to this Place, we had 12 Pieces of Cannon ſent
by Prince <hi>Vaudemont.</hi> Beſides this, Count <hi>Naſſau-weilbourg</hi>

Squadrons of Horſe along the way through the <hi>Bois de

the ſame Evening <hi>Rantzaw</hi>'s Brigade was commanded

<hi>Anderlecht Porte</hi> and that of <hi>Flanders,</hi> for the Defence

That they cou'd eaſily have maſter'd the Towns they were

<hi>Bellaſis</hi> his Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with the Regiment

               </p>
               <p>During all this hurry, and terrible preparations for the
Bombarding of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the Elect'reſs of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was in
her 7th. Month big with Child; which ſo affected her,
that ſhe miſcarried this Evening of a Boy, to the great
Grief of the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the whole Court,
and I dare ſay no leſs, to the Regret of the King and
Queen of <hi>Poland:</hi> This Miſcarriage made the Elect'reſs
dangerouſly ill; and the Elector at this time was carrying
on the Siege of the Caſtle of <hi>Namur.</hi> So that the <hi>French</hi>
Bombs have not only kindled a Fire in <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> but (may
be) as far as <hi>Warſaw,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador has us'd
all his Art to extenuate the Matter at the Court of <hi>Poland.</hi>
At Night the Enemies open'd the Trench between the
Fauxbourg of <hi>Coukelberg</hi> and the Gate of <hi>Anderlecht,</hi> to
erect here their Batteries, where they could not only
bring them nearer to the Town, but alſo the Town lying
upon the deſcent of a Hill towards this Place, it was all
open and expos'd to the Enemy's Cannon and Mortars;
and that which did very much facilitate the making of
their Bomb batteries cloſe to the Town, was two great
Barns, one thatched and the other ſlated, juſt t'other ſide
of the over-flow'd bottom before <hi>Anderlecht Porte:</hi> They
work'd ſecurely and undiſcover'd behind theſe two Barns,
where they had placed their Mortars; and becauſe the
thatch'd Barn could eaſily be ſet on fire by our Cannon
from the Rampart, they fill'd it all up with Earth to hinder
the effect of the fire. There was a good Breaſt-work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cauſey between <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Anderlecht,</hi> where the
Garriſon had always an advanc'd Guard: This Poſt was
now defended by a Major and 200 Men; but becauſe it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56660:62"/>
was too near <hi>Anderlecht</hi> the head Quarter, by which, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
could go into their Camp every Night from the Town,
the Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> order'd a good Detachment of the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Swiſs</hi> Guards to attack this Poſt about Midnight;
which the Major defended very bravely for near an Hour,
but was at laſt forc'd to yield to the Enemies Power: The
Fire of this Attack alarm'd our Camp, but without any
farther Conſequence. The Enemies having this Poſt,
plac'd Guards in all the Houſes along the Cauſey to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Gate of <hi>Anderlecht,</hi> the Meadows on both ſides of it
lying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the Enemies were working at their Trench, which
they had drawn almoſt parallel to the Walls of the Town,
between <hi>Anderlecht</hi> and <hi>Flanders Portes;</hi> which Work they
had conſiderably advanc'd. The Magiſtrates of <hi>Bruſſels</hi>
had order'd all their beſt Cannon to be mounted upon the
Baſtions and Half-moons on this ſide of the Town, of
which ſome of them were 24 Pounders; but they were ſo
ill provided with Ammunition that they could be but ill
ſerved: They had 24 Pounders, but they had no Ball for
this <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Gunners had but little Experience, and we ſupply'd 'em
with a Detachment of our own. However, the Cannon
play'd the whole Day from the Town, and did the Enemies
ſome Miſchief, and kill'd them ſeveral Men, tho' not ſo
many as they would have done, nor ruin'd ſo much their
Works, if they had had better Ball to good Cannon.
Some fir'd from the Baſtions and Half-moons of <hi>Anderlecht

<hi>Waterloo</hi> this Day to the Camp before the Caſtle of <hi>Namur;</hi>
and the next, the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> came from thence

Town as much as lay in his Power, with his Preſence,
with his Authority, and with his Counſel: And indeed
he was ſenſibly touched with the Misfortunes and Barbarous
Uſage of this poor Town, and expos'd himſelf among
the thickeſt of the Bombs to encourage the People, and to
comfort them in their Loſſes, and to keep order as much
as was poſſible in ſo much Confuſion and Miſery. The
3d. in the Morning, the Enemies had finiſhed their Trench
and Battteries; they had made two Batteries, of about 10
Pieces of Cannon each, upon the heighth of the Riſing
Ground behind their Trench; they had a deep hollow
way juſt within their Trench, which very much added
to the ſtrength and ſafety of it; and they mounted it
daily by the Left, towards <hi>Flanders Porte,</hi> under the cover
of Hedges, and rows of Trees. Between Twelve and

               <p>A <hi>Manifeſto</hi> of the ſame Nature was publiſh'd in the
<hi>Paris-Gazette</hi> only with this difference. That it magnifies
more the <hi>French</hi> King's Reluctancy to ſuch Undertakings,
and his Abhorrence of ſuch Executions, as if he knew
nothing of the Matter before, till the Inhumane Allies
taught it him at <hi>Dieppe, Havre-de-Grace, St. Malo</hi>'s <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
and <hi>Calais.</hi> Beſides, That the Allies had hitherto
made it their principal Glory to bombard Places, which
had no other ſhare in the War, but their Sighs, Wiſhes,
and Prayers to ſee an end of it. Alas! poor People!
they have had no other ſhare in the War, but their Wiſhes
for Peace, they have not done the leaſt Prejudice to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Commerce, and Navigation; their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers
have not infeſted our Coaſts, and enrich'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by the Spoils of our beſt Merchant-Ships. No,
theſe poor innocent harmleſs People have had no ſhare in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56660:63"/>
the Miſchiefs of this War, they have remain'd quiet at
home praying for Peace. The Gentleman adds, That it
has been in the King's Power to bombard the Towns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Allies, but that he had hitherto avoided
it, expecting that the Allies themſelves would put a ſtop
to ſuch Proceedings, but now that he was forc'd to it by
way of Repriſal; witneſs <hi>Liege;</hi> 'tis true that he could
have bombarded <hi>Ghendt</hi> and <hi>Bruges</hi> this Campaign, but
the bombarding of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> would make more noiſe of the
invincible Monarch's Power; and then the Caſtle of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi>
was preſs'd, and the <hi>French</hi> were reſolv'd to attempt
the Relief of it, ſo that we need not thank the <hi>French</hi>
King's Goodneſs if <hi>Ghendt</hi> and <hi>Bruges</hi> eſcap'd. At laſt the
<hi>Manifeſto</hi> concludes with magnifying the Greatneſs of
the Action, that it was done in the Face of Prince <hi>Vaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>'s
Army, who did not dare to prevent the Bombarding
of this Place, by hazarding of a Battel; whereas <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s
Army only look'd for an occaſion of fighting. And here
he tells a Truth which he all along ſeem'd to conceal: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Bombarding of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> was for a Repriſal to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
the Miſchiefs upon this Town, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Dutch</hi> did to the Sea-Ports of <hi>France;</hi> but now at laſt it is
to bring the Allies to a Battel, that they attempt the bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barding
of <hi>Bruſſels:</hi> They thought the Allies would have
hazarded any thing rather than ſuffer the burning of this
Town; but they have been miſtaken, and <hi>Namur</hi> taken;
their coming before <hi>Bruſſels</hi> has not reliev'd it as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Letter, it is more a Wonder that ſuch
Reaſons ſhould be alledged for the bombarding of it, than
that the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould bombard it at all: For the ways
of the <hi>French</hi> are ſo well known, that without pretending
to alledge any thing to juſtifie their Proceeding, I dare ſay
no body wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d have been ſurpriz'd at it: But to pretend to
bombard <hi>Bruſſels</hi> with Pain and Reluctancy, as if they
were forc'd to it by way of Repriſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as if his Moſt
Chriſtian Majſtey abhorr'd ſuch Proceedings, is ſuch inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
Stuff, that the whole World knows the contrary.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56660:64"/>
If a Man red this Letter that knew nothing of the Actions
of the fore-going Years, he would believe the <hi>French</hi> to be
the moſt merciful People in the World, and that they did
not know what Bombarding was, till we had taught it them.
Whereas this barbarous Treatment of Towns is wholly due
to them, and 'tis they themſelves that have firſt practis'd it
in the World: They began firſt with <hi>Argiers;</hi> and 'tis 12
Years ſince they began to treat Chriſtians in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as they had chaſtis'd this Neſt of miſcreant Pyrates.
<hi>Genoua, Audenarde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> above all Places, ſhould
not read the Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi>'s Letter. But in this War
the <hi>French</hi> have more openly practis'd their incendiary
Trade; they have not only bombarded <hi>Liege,</hi> the laſt
Campaign was Four Years, but at the beginning of this
War, they have more cruelly and barbarouſly deſtroy'd
Towns that were in their own Poſſeſſion, and that rely'd
upon the publick Faith of their own Capitulations: Some
Reaſon may be alledg'd to juſtifie the bombarding of an
Enemy's Town. We have bombarded their Sea Ports,
becauſe they doe us all the Miſchief they can: But
what Reaſon can be given for the burning of ſo many Towns
in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> that had deliver'd themſelves up to the
Dauphin's Army, as <hi>Worms, Spire, Openheim,</hi> and <hi>Franken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
Manheim,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Heidelberg?</hi> In ſhort, if
the Enemies publiſh'd theſe Reaſons to fling Duſt in the
Eyes of the Allies, they have been mightily miſtaken;
and whereas they would have thrown the original Cauſe
of the bombarding of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> upon the King of <hi>England,</hi>
to animate the People of this Country againſt him, their
Mine has ſprung backwards, and has rather ſerv'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
their Hatred againſt the <hi>French.</hi> They know that
we have bombarded thoſe Neſts of Privateers that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and ſpoil our Trade to the utmoſt of their Power;
but they expected better Treatment to a Town that had
never done the <hi>French</hi> the leaſt harm, but had rather in a
manner a free Trade with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo far the bombarding
of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> has done a great deal of Miſchief to the <hi>French</hi>
King's own Subjects, who had vaſt Effects in this Town,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56660:64"/>
and ſeveral have been ruin'd by it; but Miſchief muſt be
done, to magnifie an invincible Monarch's Power in 'ſpite
of the Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> let it fall where it will. I have
yet omitted a conſiderable Reflexion upon this Letter, and
that is, That the Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> would have an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
from the Town in Five Hours about a Propoſal to
make a Ceſſation of Bombarding on both ſides, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
not only the King but all the Allies; and yet this
Anſwer muſt be given in Five Hours, elſe he muſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
without delay the Orders of his Maſter, which makes
his Letter a Jeſt, and nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Villeroy</hi> had promis'd to execute the Orders of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
after Five of the Clock, he was then as good as his
Word. Between Five and Six the Enemies began to throw
their Bombs into the Town, firing them one by one, and
their red Balls, till about Ten of the Clock at Night. The
Marquis <hi>de Mirmont</hi> Major-General had then the Guard
towards the Enemy, with Brigadier <hi>Packmoer.</hi> About
this time of Night the Enemies began to play moſt
furiouſly, with their Mortars and red Balls by whole Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries:
The Fire was then in ſeveral Places of the Town,
and there they were ſure to throw their Bombs, and fire their
red Balls to encreaſe the Fire, and to hinder the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
from quenching of it: They had 25 Mortars in two
Batteries behind the two Barns, which (I reckon) they
fir'd three times an Hour round at leaſt, and all together,
ſo that one could ſee 25 Bombs at once in the Air, which
they immediately follow'd with their Batteries of Cannon,
charg'd with red Balls, which did ſo much the more Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
that the moſt wealthy part of the Town is all
open on this ſide lying upon the deſcent of a Hill towards
the River: The Enemies continu'd this Fire-work all
Night. The next Day we fir'd upon them as much as we
could from our Batteries by the Gate of <hi>Anderlecht,</hi> ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to beat down the Barns about their Ears which
cover'd their Mortars The Chevalier <hi>de Montgon,</hi> and
Two Officers of the <hi>French</hi> King's Guards were kill'd with
a Cannon Ball by the Duke <hi>du Maine.</hi> The whole Day
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56660:65"/>
the Enemies fir'd with their Mortars and Cannon as they
had done the Night before; and by this time the <hi>Stadthuys</hi>
and Market-Place was all burnt down and ſeveral Streets
about it. They neglected the neareſt part of the Town,
towards the Gates of <hi>Anderlecht</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> as being the
pooreſt: The upper or nobler part of the Town, about
the Court, and towards the Gate of <hi>Namur,</hi> they could
not reach, but 'twas the Wealthy and Trading Part they
were reſolv'd to deſtroy, which lay about the Heart of the
Town. In the Evening, Major-General <hi>La Meloniere</hi> had
the Guard with Brigadier St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The Elector of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
order'd beſides, a Detachment of Ten Squadrons of our
Horſe, encamp'd at <hi>Scarbeck,</hi> to guard all the Streets lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Fire, to prevent Rogues and Thieves from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in, and to prevent all Diſorders; the Ten Squadrons
were commanded by a Brigadier. A Detachment of Foot
was alſo order'd to go in, and help the Burghers to pull
down the Houſes, and quench the Fre. At Night the
Wind grew high and ſtormy, which very much enrag'd
the Fire, and made the Miſchief of the Enemies Bombs
and red Balls greater than it would otherwiſe have been.
Notwithſtanding the Care that was taken to prevent Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
in the Confuſion of the Fire, ſeveral Soldiers made
a ſhift to get within the Guards, and plunder'd the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
whilſt they were burning: The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>
caus'd one to be hang'd upon the ſpot. Several Thieves of
the Town took (no doubt) this convenient occaſion to
make Booty; for the Inhabitants thought that the Enemies
Bombs could not reach beyond the Market-Place, which
made them crow'd all their Wealth in the Houſes beyond
it, where they thought them ſecure; but 'twas in theſe very
Places that the thickeſt of the Enemies Bombs fell, which
made the Inhabitants Loſs ſo much the greater. The 5th.
about Nine of the Clock in the Morning, the Mortars ceas'd,
and about Noon the Cannon, having fir'd from <hi>Saturday.</hi> Six
of the Clock in the Evening to this time, and always
(except the firſt three or four Hours) by whole Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which made the moſt terrible Bombarding that (I
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56660:65"/>
believe) ever has been known, and render'd the Town a
moſt piteous and diſmal Spectacle. They fir'd their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
being 25 in number, 39 hours full; which being (as
I computed it) fir'd three times an hour at leaſt, amounts
to 2925 Bombs thrown into the Place. The fire of the
Cannon laſted from the ſame time <hi>Saturday</hi> Night till <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
Noon, in all 42 hours, which at three times an hour
amounts to 2268 red Balls. This Computation of the
Bombs and Red Balls, is (I dare ſay) much within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs.
And indeed, the Damage done to the Town has
too much anſwer'd the Enemies terrible Preparations; all
the Heart of the Town (the Wealthy and Trading Part
of it) being burnt down to the very Ground: and as the
Figure of the Town is Oval, ſo are the Ruines caus'd by
the Enemy, rekoning your croſs Diameters of the Circle,
the one from the <hi>Stein Porte</hi> to the <hi>Fiſh-Market,</hi> and the
other from half way up the <hi>Berg-ſtreet,</hi> and near the <hi>Wood-Market,</hi>
over the Market-Place, and ſo towards the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
between <hi>Halle Porte</hi> and that of <hi>Anderlecht;</hi> all this
is in a manner burnt down to the Ground, with a great
many rich Churches, and fine Cloyſters involv'd in the
Ruines. The laſt Church they burnt, which was that
without <hi>Steine Porte,</hi> they ſeem'd to do it on purpoſe on
the <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, firing all their Red Balls upon it;
and this was the wealthieſt Pariſh-Church in <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enrich'd within with very coſtly Ornaments, ſuch as
Altars, (which were the fineſt and the moſt ſtately in the
Town) Pictures, and Images, and abundance of Marble
and Porphyry to adorn and ſet out the Altars. It is no
wonder that ſeveral Churches ſhould ſuffer in the thick of
ſuch a Conflagration, and ſo this cannot be taxed of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
diſreſpect to theſe Holy Places: But that this Church
ſhou'd be particularly ſingl'd out, as it was in the <hi>Monday</hi>
Morning, cannot but be thought on with horrour, by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who believe that their Saviour dwells there Bodily:
And yet this has been done by thoſe very Perſons who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be the only Aſſerters and Maintainers of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:56660:66"/>
A little before the Enemies Mortars had done, we at
laſt fir'd with our Red Balls one of the Barns, behind
which the Enemies had made their Bomb-Batteries; and it
had been well for the Town if they had pull'd them
down at firſt, as ſoon as they heard of the Enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;
they had then wanted this Conveniency of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Mortars under cover ſo cloſe to the Town. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Enemies had done with their Mortars and Cannon,
they began this Afternoon to draw them off their Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and becauſe 'twas expected the Army wou'd have
march'd back towards <hi>Halle,</hi> the General beat in our Camp
by <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> to be ready to march of our ſide: However
the <hi>French</hi> did not ſtir; which made ſome People believe
they deſign'd to exchange their Batteries, and bring them
towards the <hi>Lacker Porte,</hi> and the Canal, to burn the King's
Magazines of Hay, which were of the other ſide, and ſee
how far their Bombs would reach in the Town this way.
But I ſuppoſe their Bombs were ſpent, and the King's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines,
which were very great, were ſav'd. The fartheſt
Bomb the Enemies ſhot from before <hi>Anderlecht Porte,</hi> reach'd
juſt below Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi>'s Houſe, belonging to the
King, and juſt by the Court; it broke in the fall before it
came to the Ground, and a piece of the Shell kill'd an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Woman in the Street: She was dreſs'd like a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
and had a conſiderable quantity of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in her Pocket; but I have never heard who ſhe was.
The 6th. the Enemies having drawn off the Day and
Night before all their Cannon and Mortars, (tho' not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Loſs, for the Cannon from the Town ſtill fir'd upon
them the Afternoon before, during their Work) they
ſent them back again to <hi>Mons</hi> before with a ſtrong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment,
and their Army was ready to follow them.
The 7th. the Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> withdrew his Army
from before <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and march'd back and encamp'd
between <hi>Halle,</hi> and <hi>Enghien.</hi> The ſame Day, the Two

and <hi>Waterlo,</hi> and march'd upon the Left to <hi>Sombref,</hi>
paſſing the <hi>Dyle</hi> at old <hi>Genap,</hi> upon four Bridges laid over
this little River, two for each Column, and ſo on between
the Abbey of <hi>Villers Perwijs</hi> upon our Left Flank, and
<hi>Melle</hi> upon our Right, the Artillery and Baggage by the
Cauſey. We came late to the Camp, by reaſon of ſome
Deſilés which interrupted our March between theſe two
Places. Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> had his Quarter at <hi>Sombref,</hi> with
our Left here, and our Right at <hi>Marbais,</hi> and the Plains of
<hi>Fleury</hi> before us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The 10th. we march'd ſtill on upon the
Left, to take up the ſtrong Camp of <hi>Maſy. Buchan</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
join'd us upon this March from <hi>Malines.</hi> We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
at <hi>Maſy,</hi> our two Lines in the Figure of a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle;
the Convex part of it at <hi>Maſy,</hi> our Right before
<hi>Temploux</hi> and the <hi>Cenſe</hi> or Farm <hi>de Boquet,</hi> and our Left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Spy</hi> and <hi>Melmont</hi> towards the <hi>Sambre.</hi> Prince <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demont</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:56660:67"/>
took his Quarter at <hi>Golſines,</hi> an old ruinous Caſtle,
formerly the dwelling-Place of the Counts of <hi>Namur.
Fitspatrick</hi>'s, and <hi>Selwyn</hi>'s Brigades, encamp'd before the
Prince's Quarter, at <hi>Beſſire,</hi> to take up a high Ground which
forms a Tongue of Land towards <hi>Maſy,</hi> ſomething ſteep
towards <hi>Sombref,</hi> and cover'd with thick Woods. Some
Horſe and Dragoons encamp'd upon the left of theſe two
Brigades, cloſe to the Village of <hi>Beſſire,</hi> and two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Dragoons at the Prince's Quarter. And becauſe
this is the Camp that muſt decide the Fate of the Caſtle
of <hi>Namur,</hi> I ſhall give a ſhort Deſcription of it. There
is a little River that has its ſpring about <hi>Gemblours,</hi> and
falls into the <hi>Sambre,</hi> which contributes very much to the
ſtrength of this Camp; for in its ſhort courſe to the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi>
it runs along a narrow Valley, with Hills upon each
ſide, which makes the Paſſage of it difficult, and ſo much
the more that the ſide of the Hills towards the River is
cover'd with thick Trees. At <hi>Maſy</hi> the Ground is more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
on both ſides of the River, which makes this a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Paſſage, being the only one from <hi>Gemblours</hi> to the
<hi>Sambre</hi> that is convenient for an Army. Beyond <hi>Maſy,</hi> as
this River comes near the <hi>Sambre</hi> by <hi>Melmont,</hi> it runs at
the Foot of a ſteep Hill cover'd with thick Trees, which
made our Left between <hi>Spy</hi> and <hi>Melmont</hi> inacceſſible to the
Enemy. Our Right was cover'd from <hi>Beſſire</hi> and <hi>Golſines,</hi>
the Prince's Quarter, (beſides the little River now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd)
with ſeveral thick Woods, as far as <hi>Gemblours;</hi> and
there was no paſſage from the Enemy into this Camp, but
by <hi>Gemblours, Conroy le Chaſteau,</hi> and ſo to the narrow
Plain before our Camp taken up by the Brigades of <hi>Fits<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick</hi>
and <hi>Selwyn,</hi> which Plain goes from <hi>Gemblours</hi> to
<hi>Beſſire,</hi> with a Wood upon the Right, and another upon the
Left: This we took care to fortifie with a Retrenchment
from the River of <hi>Maſy</hi> (which the Maps call <hi>Orne</hi>) to
Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi>'s Quarter, croſs this narrow Plain, to
defend the Paſſage from <hi>Gemblours</hi> to our Camp. <hi>Maſy</hi>
(which is a Gentlemen's Houſe juſt upon the little River
now mention'd, where it commands a Stone Bridge over
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56660:68"/>
it) is two Leagues diſtant from <hi>Namur,</hi> and is the Paſſage
from thence to <hi>Bruſſels, Mons,</hi> and <hi>Charleroy.</hi> And being
now ſo near this Place, it brings me to ſpeak of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in the Siege of the <hi>Caſtle, Cohorne,</hi> and other Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
between the <hi>Sambre</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> which render
it one of the ſtrongeſt Fortreſſes of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We took Poſſeſſion of the Town (as we have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
the 27th. of <hi>July,</hi> after the <hi>French</hi> had all withdrawn
into the Caſtle for the defence of it; We quitted likewiſe
the Line of Circumvallation before the Town, which of
it ſelf, with the <hi>Sambre</hi> and the Poſts we had upon it at
the Abbey of <hi>Salſen,</hi> and the <hi>Ballance,</hi> did ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
the Caſtle. Thirty Battalions, <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi>
were ſent the ſame Day out of this Line of Circumvalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to join Prince <hi>Vaudemont;</hi> and the day after, (28th.)
the King left his Quarter at <hi>Maiſon rouge,</hi> to get t'other ſide
of the <hi>Sambre</hi> at the Abbey of <hi>Malogne,</hi> which hitherto
had been the Elector's Quarter; he left it to the King,
and took his Quarter, during the Siege of the Caſtle, at a
Cloyſter of the <hi>Carmelites</hi> near the <hi>Meuſe:</hi> The reſt of the
Troops before the Town paſs'd the <hi>Sambre</hi> (whereof Six
were <hi>Engliſh</hi>) to be employ'd in the Siege. So that we
had now before the Caſtle, to carry on the Siege, 42 Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions.
The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiments of <hi>Seymour, Columbine,
Stanley,</hi> and <hi>Lauder,</hi> encamp'd at the <hi>Maiſon Blanche,</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Holſtein Ploen</hi>'s Quarter, oppoſite to <hi>Flavennes.</hi>
The next Day, Collonel <hi>Seymour</hi>'s Regiment mounted in
the Line we had made before the <hi>Caſotte</hi> when we
gain'd the Stone Line made by the <hi>French:</hi> Captain <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi>
of the ſame Regiment was kill'd. And this Day
the manner of mounting the Trenches before the Caſtle
was agreed upon: That it ſhou'd be mounted by Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of 100 Men out of each Regiment, making the
Number of 4000 Men, (beſides 700 Men to work) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by a Major-General, a Brigadier, Four Collonels,
Four Lieutenant-Collonels, Four Majors, and one Major
of Brigade, 37 Captains, 40 Lieutenants, and 35 Enſigns:
The two Battalions of Guards gave none. The 30th. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56660:68"/>
to this Regulation, Count <hi>de Rivera,</hi> Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> mounted the Guard of the Lines,
and my Lord <hi>Cuts</hi> Brigadier, with the Colonels <hi>Lauder,
Stochauſen, Marquet,</hi> and Count <hi>d'Enhoff</hi> Colonel of the
<hi>Brandenbourghs,</hi> who had the Misfortune to be wounded.
The 31ſt. the King went from hence to my Lord of
<hi>Athlone</hi>'s Camp at <hi>Waterlo.</hi> At Night Major-General
<hi>Arnheim,</hi> of the <hi>Brandenbourgh</hi> Troops, mounted the
Guard, with the Prince of <hi>Holſtein Norbourg</hi> Brigadier,
and Colonels <hi>Stanley, Sparre, Capol</hi> and <hi>Bekel,</hi> the laſt of
<hi>Brandenbourghs.</hi> The Enemies ſtill fir'd from the <hi>Caſotte</hi>
and cover'd way upon our Line, but hitherto with little
damage. The 1ſt. of <hi>August,</hi> Major-General <hi>Lindeboom</hi>
commanded, with Brigadier <hi>Dedem,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Seymour</hi>
commanded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Detachment. We had by this
time finiſh'd ſeveral Batteries to fire againſt the Caſtle and
<hi>Cohorne,</hi> being ready for the Cannon and Mortars. The
2d. ſome of the ſaid Batteries began firſt to play, 20 Pieces
of Cannon diſpos'd in Three Batteries at the <hi>Fauxbourg
St. Croix</hi> upon the <hi>Sambre,</hi> juſt without <hi>Bruſſels Porte,</hi>
which fir'd againſt the ſide of the <hi>Cohorne</hi> oppoſite to the
<hi>Sambre.</hi> We had another Battery of the <hi>Brandenbourgh</hi>
ſide of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> to fire againſt the Lower Town along
this River; beſides ſeveral Mortars to incommode the
Enemies in the Lower Town, and to hinder their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Water-ſide. We had another of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitz</hi>
and Four Mortars upon the Left of our Line, before
the <hi>Caſotte</hi> towards the <hi>Sambre:</hi> But all this did no great
damage to the Enemies. Major-General <hi>Cohorne,</hi> who had
the Management of the Siege of the Caſtle, was preparing
another Entertainment for them from the Town. For
tho' Count <hi>Guiſcard</hi> pretended to deliver up the Town for
its Safety and Preſervation, not that they were forc'd to
it by the Neceſſity of their own Affairs, yet it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
in the Capitulation; wherein there was no Proviſion
made to prevent Hoſtilities between the Town and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
as it had been agreed upon in the Capitulation made
with the <hi>French</hi> when they took it. At Night Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56660:69"/>
                  <hi>Sweryn</hi> commanded, with my Lord <hi>Cuts</hi> Brigadier,
and Colonel <hi>Columbine</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> We open'd the
Trench this Night before the <hi>Cohorne</hi> in two places, to
make two parallel Lines for our Approaches between the
<hi>Cohorne</hi> and the <hi>Sambre.</hi> The firſt upon the Right was
open'd at the Left of our Line againſt the <hi>Caſotte,</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it down the Hill towards the <hi>Sambre:</hi> The ſecond
upon the Left, where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mounted, was open'd in
the Deſcent of the Hill nearer to the <hi>Sambre.</hi> A <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh</hi>
Major was wounded this Night. The 2d. in the
Evening, His Majeſty came back to the Siege from the
Camp at <hi>Waterlo</hi> by <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> and the next Morning his
Electoral Highneſs went to ſee the Elect'reſs that had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried
upon the Approach of the <hi>French</hi> before <hi>Bruſſels,</hi>
and to be preſent to give his Orders during the bombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
The ſame Day, Major-General <hi>la Cave</hi> of the
<hi>Brandenbourgh</hi> Forces reliev'd the Trenches, with the Prince
of <hi>Holſtein Norbourg</hi> Brigadier, and Colonel <hi>Lauder.</hi> I
ſhall omit the Names of the other Colonels, being For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners,
and unknown in <hi>England.</hi> We continu'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
our Trench upon the Right down the Hill, and the
other upon the Left nearer to the <hi>Sambre,</hi> between which
we began to work at a Line of Communication. The
Beſieged had Three <hi>Fauconets</hi> or Drakes within the Palliſado's
of the <hi>Caſotte</hi> to fire upon our Workmen, from whence
they would ſometimes detach ſmall Pellotoons of Men to
incommode our Work. The 4th. Major-General <hi>Rivera,</hi>
and Brigadier <hi>Dedem,</hi> mounted the Trenches: Colonel <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
commanded the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> We advanc'd our Trenches
near 250 Paces, which Work we travers'd with Faſcines to
hinder it from being flock'd by the Enemy. On the other
ſide of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> oppoſite to the foot or firſt precinct of
the <hi>Terra nova,</hi> at the bottom of the Hill, we open'd a
Battery of 17 Pieces of Cannon to fire againſt the Lower
Town, and the Horn-work of <hi>Bale.</hi> We re-inforc'd at
the ſame time our Battery before <hi>Bruſſels Porte</hi> at <hi>Sancte
Croix</hi> againſt the ſide of the <hi>Cohorne.</hi> Upon the Right of
all towards the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> where our great Line againſt the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56660:69"/>
Works of the Caſtle finiſhes, we plac'd three 12 Pounders
in the room of three others of a leſſer <hi>Calibre,</hi> to fire in the
Lower Town which lay open to our view from this Place.
Lieutenant <hi>Wallis</hi> of the Royal Regiment, one of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers
that ſerv'd in the Siege of the Caſtle, was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this Night. The other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Engineers were, Major
<hi>Blood,</hi> then of Colonel <hi>Seymour</hi>'s Regiment, now Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Colonel
to Sir <hi>Matthew Bridges</hi> his Regiment, known
before for his Services of this kind in <hi>Ireland;</hi> Captain
<hi>Burgh,</hi> of the Royal Regiment, Son to the late Lord-Biſhop
of <hi>Ardagh;</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Richards,</hi> of Brigadier <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi>'s
Regiment, Brother to Colonel <hi>Richards;</hi> who all
gave very good Proofs of their Abilities in this kind.</p>
               <p>The 5th. we produc'd our Trenches 100 Paces, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Line to the Left towards the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and the Point
of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> where we made an <hi>Angle</hi> ſaillant, turning
again a little to the Right, which we advanc'd 100 Paces
more. About 60 Dragoons ſallied out of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi>
which at firſt put our Workmen in ſome diſorder; but
they were immediately rally'd by the Care of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.
The Enemies plac'd this Day Three <hi>Fauconnets</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Drakes upon the point of the Cover'd-way of the <hi>Cohorne</hi>
which looks towards the <hi>Sambre,</hi> to incommode us from
hence in our Lines. A Bomb fell this Day in the <hi>Caſotte,</hi>
which put fire to ſome Grenades, not without ſome da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to the Enemies. Major-General <hi>Arnheim</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Trenches this Night, with the Prince of <hi>Anhalt</hi>
Brigadier, of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonel <hi>Seymour.</hi> The 6th we
advanc'd our Trench upon the Left 170 Paces, and that
upon the Right conſiderably, to bring both between the
ſide of the <hi>Cohorne</hi> and the <hi>Sambre:</hi> But the Rain was very
troubleſome to us at this time, which coming down in
Torrents from the top of the Hill, fill'd our Trenches with
Water, which were made upon the ſide of it. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
work'd at anouter Line before the Cover'd-way of the
<hi>Ravelin</hi> of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> upon the Deſcent of the Hill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and indeed, from the taking of the Town, to this time,
they have ſtill been making new Retrenchments down
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56660:70"/>
the Hill before the Cover'd-way of the <hi>Cohorne.</hi> They
plac'd Three Pieces of Cannon more in one of theſe
Trenches to fire upon our Works; for the Cannon of the
<hi>Cohorne</hi> being conſiderably high upon the Hill, could not
bear down upon our Trenches, for which reaſon they
were oblig'd to make theſe Retrenchments lower without
the Cover'd-way. Major-General <hi>Lindeboom</hi> had the
Trenches this Night, with the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Norbourg</hi>
Brigadier, and Colonel <hi>Columbine</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
at this time to work at ſeveral Batteries within the
Town, ſome along the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and others upon the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
between the <hi>Porte de Fer</hi> and the <hi>Sambre,</hi> which were
to fire over the Town upon the <hi>Terra nova.</hi> Upon which
the Maréchal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> threaten'd to lay the Town in
Aſhes, if we ſhould offer to make any Batteries from
thence. But 'twas reply'd of our ſide, That above 500
Sick and Wounded which they had ſtill in our Hoſpitals,
which could not be tranſported to <hi>Dinant,</hi> (where we had
ſent above 1600 ſince the Town was taken) ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for it. This Anſwer, beſides that they could only do
Miſchief to the Town, (if we would ſacrifice it) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hindering our Batteries, made them civil, and never
offer'd to fire in the Town, but where they ſaw us work
to attack them.</p>
               <p>The 7th. we began to draw a Line of Communication
from the upper Trench upon the Right, to the lower upon
the Left: We advanc'd the upper Trench with an <hi>Angle
ſaillant</hi> towards the ſide of the <hi>Cohorne;</hi> we continued
to work at our new Batteries in the Town, and re-inforc'd
the old ones with ſeveral Pieces of Cannon and Mortars.
Major-General <hi>Swerin</hi> reliev'd the Trenches this Night,
with Brigadier <hi>Dedem,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Lauder</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
The 8th. the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> return'd to the Siege from
<hi>Bruſſels.</hi> Major-General <hi>la Cave</hi> commanded the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Brigadier <hi>Horne</hi> of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> with Colonel
<hi>Stanley</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The Rain hinder'd us this Night
from advancing our Works; ſo that we only apply'd our
ſelves to put what we had done in a better defence. Our
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56660:70"/>
Works were now brought near the Enemy, which made
them fire very briskly upon us, both with Cannon and
Small-ſhot. The 9th. Major-General <hi>Rivera,</hi> and my
Lord <hi>Cuts</hi> Brigadier, mounted the Trenches, and Colonel
<hi>Seymour</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> In the Evening, a <hi>French</hi> Officer
was taken ſwimming down the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> endeavouring to
get into the Place: He came from <hi>Dinant,</hi> and had ſwam
a great way to come undiſcovered in the beginning of the
Night. He deny'd that he had any particular Commiſſion,
but that his Regiment was in the Place, and that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to repair to his Poſt. About Midnight, the
Enemies made a Sally of 200 Dragoons and 600 Grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
Major-General <hi>Rivera</hi> commanded the Right
Trench, and my Lord <hi>Cuts</hi> the Left. Major General
<hi>Rivera</hi> had plac'd a Captain and 60 Men without the
Trench upon the Right, to lie down upon their Arms, and
to have Centries to obſerve the Enemy to prevent ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.
My Lord <hi>Cuts</hi> had done the ſame upon the Left.
The Centries of the Right gave notice, That they ſaw a
Body of Men coming down the Hill from the <hi>Caſotte.</hi>
Upon which we ſtood all to our Arms in our Trenches,
and made ſome Detachments without to oppoſe to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
The <hi>French</hi> Grenadiers came down with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Fury, making a great Noiſe as ſoon as they came near
our Works, to ſtrike a Terror amongſt our Men; but we
were ready for them, which they found by the briskneſs
of our fire: The Van of the Enemies would then have
retreated the ſame way they came, but being hinder'd by
thoſe that ſuſtain'd them, they were oblig'd to turn to the
Right, where they fell into the fire of the Out guards
we had plac'd to cover our Trenches. The Dragoons
ſallied (much about the ſame time with the Grenadiers)
out of the Caſtle, coming between the <hi>Cohorne</hi> and the
<hi>Sambre,</hi> where they fell among the Out-guards plac'd by
my Lord <hi>Cuts</hi> to cover our Left Trench. We had then,
as we had every Night, a Body of Dragoons commanded
by a Major, between our Left Trench and the Abbey of
<hi>Salſen;</hi> this Night they were <hi>Spaniards,</hi> commanded by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56660:71"/>
Major <hi>Zuniga:</hi> My Lord <hi>Cuts</hi> brought him up immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with his Body to ſuccour our Men, where he fell upon
the Enemies Dragoons, and purſued them to the very
Paliſiades of the Caſtle, making a conſiderable Slaughter
among them. The Major had his Horſe ſhot under
him in this Action; for which, and for his conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Service at this time, his Majeſty ſent him a Horſe out
of his Stable the next Day, with rich Furniture, and a
very fine Sword. We had in this Occaſion but Four-<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
One <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> and Three <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers, kill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d.
One <hi>Engliſh</hi> Enſign, and Seven Soldiers; One <hi>Bavarian</hi>
Lieutenant, and one Soldier; one Major, one Lieutenant,
and 17 <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Soldiers; one <hi>Dutch</hi> Enſign, and 11
Soldiers, wounded. We continued this Day (9th.) to
work with great vigour upon our new Batteries in the
Town, from whence we expected the Succeſs of this
Siege; for hitherto we had done no damage to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Works, and had only advanc'd our Trenches. The
10th. the Enemies beat a Parley to reclaim ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Officers they had loſt the Night before, if Priſoners,
or to have leave to look for their Bodies among the Dead.
At Night Major-General <hi>Arnheim</hi> commanded in the
Trenches, with the Prince of <hi>Anhalt</hi> Brigadier, and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Columbine</hi> of our Forces. We perfected this Night our
Communication between the upper and the lower Trench.
Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> came and encamp'd at <hi>Maſy</hi> this Evening,
as has been ſaid before.</p>
               <p>The 11th. early in the Morning we open'd all the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
we had made in the Town, which made a moſt
terrible noiſe, and no doubt caus'd a great Diſorder and
Conſternation among the Enemies; for the Bombs play'd
inceſſantly in all their Works, and from all ſides, ſo that the
Beſieged could hardly ſtirr, without running the hazard of
being wounded, or knock'd on the Head with our Bombs
that were ſtill ſhowring down among them. Our Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were made along the <hi>Sambre;</hi> the firſt at the Village
of <hi>Sainte Croix,</hi> where we had 20 Guns diſpos'd in Two
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56660:71"/>
Batteries: the next in the <hi>Sambre</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels</hi>'s Baſtions,
theſe fir'd againſt the ſide of the <hi>Cohorne</hi> towards the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to make a breach. Some from the <hi>Bruſſel</hi>'s Baſtion
fir'd againſt the Courtin of the <hi>Terra nova,</hi> which comes
down the Hill towards the <hi>Sambre.</hi> Several other Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were made upon the very Bank of the <hi>Sambre</hi> within
the Town, upon the Wall they have along this River,
which fir'd very furiouſly upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fore-ſaid Courtin of
the <hi>Terra nova.</hi> We had ſome other Batteries of a leſſer
<hi>Calibre</hi> (the others being generally 24 Pounders) diſpos'd
upon the Walk, or <hi>Chemin des rondes</hi> of the Courtin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Porte de Fer</hi> and that of <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> theſe fir'd in
reverſe over the Town, and the River, upon the aſcent of
the <hi>Terra nova,</hi> and old Caſtle, which over-looks the Town,
and lay open to our view, which very much incommoded
the Enemies; for they could hardly ſtir in the Caſtle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being ſeen, and all the Houſes in it lay expos'd to this

to ruine the Work, and to incommode the Enemies, who
had their Stables and Stores in the Lower Town along the
<hi>Meuſe,</hi> and a great many, both Officers and Soldiers, were
quarter'd here, being more under cover. 'Twas compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that we had now 136 Pieces of Cannon diſpos'd in
ſeveral Batteries againſt the Caſtle and Out-works, and 50
Mortars and <hi>Haubitz;</hi> which from this Day, till the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56660:72"/>
this being the firſt Day that we open'd our Batteries to
make a breach, we may reckon that we have carry'd the
Caſtle, with all its prodigious Out-works, in 11 Days, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
capitulated the 22d. The Beſieged had 9 Pieces of
Cannon, and 3 Mortars, with which they endeavour'd to
incommode us in our Batteries in the Town, but they were
ſoon ſilenc'd. Monſieur <hi>de Rondeau,</hi> formerly Governour
of the Caſtle for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and 82 Years old,
was kill'd this Day by one of theſe Cannons. Prince <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demont</hi>
having encamp'd with his Army at <hi>Maſy</hi> the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
the King went this day to his Camp, who with the
Elector had hitherto gone twice a day in the Trenches, to
viſit our Approaches, and to give their Directions. At
Night, Major-General <hi>Lindeboom,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein-Norburg</hi>
Brigadier, mounted the Trenches, with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Buchan</hi> of our National Forces; the Regiments
of <hi>Seymour, Columbine, Stanley,</hi> and <hi>Lauder,</hi> having been
reliev'd this Day by the Regiments of <hi>Courthop, Mackay,
Friderick Hamilton,</hi> and <hi>Buchan,</hi> from the Camp at <hi>Maſy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 12th. our Batteries continu'd with the ſame Fury
they had began Yeſterday, and we found that they play'd
to the purpoſe; for they had already tore up the ſide of
the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> and the deſcending Courtin of the <hi>Terra nova,</hi>
where they had made breach in ſo little time. Major-General
<hi>Swerin,</hi> and Brigadier <hi>Dedem,</hi> mounted the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
with Colonel <hi>Mackay</hi> of our Forces. The 13th. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General
<hi>la Cave,</hi> and Brigadier <hi>Horne,</hi> with Colonel
<hi>Friderick Hamilton</hi> commanding our Forces, mounted the
Trenches. The 14th. Major-General <hi>Rivera,</hi> my Lord
<hi>Cuts</hi> Brigadier, and Colonel <hi>Courthop.</hi> The 15th. Major-General
<hi>Arnheim,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Anhalt</hi> Brigadier, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Buchan.</hi> Theſe Four Days, our Artillery and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
continu'd as before, and widen'd very much the
Breaches, and ſtruck ſuch a Terror among the Enemies,
that they kept cloſe, hardly daring to ſhew their Heads
over their Works, for which reaſon we loſt but very few
Men in our Trenches, having had but 2 killed and 9
wounded the 4 laſt Days; in which we advanc'd our
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56660:72"/>
Trenches conſiderably, having brought them now under
the ſide of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> between it and the <hi>Sambre.</hi> The
Enemies were Maſters of a Half-moon upon the ſide of
the <hi>Sambre,</hi> at the foot of the bottom which runs down
between the <hi>Terra nova</hi> and the <hi>Cohorne:</hi> This was made
for an Out-work to the Town formerly, before the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne</hi>
was built, for which Reaſon it faces outwards towards
the Hill of the <hi>Cohorne.</hi> Our Trenches being now ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
between the <hi>Cohorne</hi> and the <hi>Sambre,</hi> it was thought
fit to diſlodge the Enemies from it. This Place was ſo
much under the command of our Batteries, along the
<hi>Sambre,</hi> on the Town ſide, that the Enemies did not dare
to ſhew themſelves in it. We put a Detachment in a
<hi>Bilander</hi> at the Abbey of <hi>Salſen,</hi> which came down the
River, to attack this Poſt; but upon the approach of our
Men, the Enemies made little Reſiſtance, and deliver'd it
up; a Lieutenant, and 17 Men, were made Priſoners in it,
having liv'd in the Vault ſeveral Days without appearing.
The <hi>Brandenbourghers</hi> at the ſame time made another Attack
to diſlodge the Enemies out of ſome Houſes they had along
the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> juſt without the Gate of the Horn-work of
<hi>Bulé,</hi> upon the way that goes to <hi>Givet,</hi> from whence they
beat the Enemy with little or no loſs, and made ſome Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.
The Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> being now expected for
the Relief of the Caſtle of <hi>Namur,</hi> Orders were given to
fortifie the <hi>Avenues</hi> of the King's Quarter at <hi>Malogne,</hi> and
the Hills that command it: For tho' there was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
that the Body of the Army could march this Way
to relieve the Place, being all cloſe Woods between the
<hi>Sambre</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> yet this was neceſſary to prevent
the ſurpriſal of flying Detachments, which having paſs'd
the <hi>Sambre,</hi> could have march'd by the Abbey of <hi>Floreff</hi>
to this Place, which is in the way between <hi>Floreff</hi> and
<hi>Namur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi>'s Army being now ſo near <hi>Namur,</hi>
(which we have brought to the Camp at <hi>Maſy</hi>) we ſhall
leave the Account of the Siege for a while, to ſpeak of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56660:73"/>
the Proceedings of the Prince's Army, and of that of the

<hi>Vaudemont</hi> came to the Camp of <hi>Maſy</hi> the 10th. his Army
conſiſting then of 70 Battalions, and 182 Squadrons.
The 11th. the ſecond Battalion of <hi>Scots</hi> Guards, and the

12th. in the Morning, all the heavy Baggage of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was commanded away, to draw up at the Bridge of
Communication upon the <hi>Meuſe</hi> below <hi>Namur:</hi> We expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
now the Enemies; and as we were then to be ſtill in
Motion to obſerve them, the heavy Baggage was ſent
away, to make the Marches of the Army eaſier, leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
and quicker; and beſides Forrage was not plenty
in our Camp after ſo long a Siege, and ſuch Armies,
which the Horſes belonging to the Baggage could find
more conveniently here, having the liberty of both ſides
of the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> The ſame Morning, Count <hi>Tilly</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General,
was detach'd with <hi>Pyper</hi>'s, and another Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade
of Horſe, by <hi>Louvain</hi> to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>de Bedmar, Meſtre de Camp</hi> General of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry,
commanded a ſmall body of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe; and
both theſe Generals were join'd and re-inforc'd at <hi>Bruſſels</hi>
by Lieutenant-General <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> who upon <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
towards <hi>Namur,</hi> march'd hither with the 10 Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
under his Command, to cover either <hi>Louvain</hi> or
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> which (our Army being now at <hi>Maſy</hi>) were
both expos'd to the <hi>French</hi> Army. The ſame Day (12th.)
the Regiments of <hi>Sparre</hi> and <hi>Knoring,</hi> and that of the
<hi>Marquet,</hi> join'd us at the Camp of <hi>Maſy,</hi> having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd
from the Siege. I cannot tell whether others were
ſent from the Camp to the Siege in their Place. The
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56660:73"/>
15th. being inform'd that the Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> (who
after the bombarding of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> had retir'd to <hi>Soigny</hi>) had
paſs'd the <hi>Senne,</hi> above <hi>Nivelle,</hi> to join the <hi>Rhine</hi> Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the other Troops he expected from the Coaſt,
and the Remainder of the Houſhold of <hi>France,</hi> which
was all commanded away from <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and that he was
incamp'd with his Right at <hi>Seneffe,</hi> and his Left towards
<hi>Arkiennes</hi> and <hi>Feluy,</hi> in order to march to the Plains of
<hi>Fleury:</hi> For this Reaſon our Right Wing of Horſe which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
towards <hi>Temploux,</hi> turning back from the Line, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to march up, and rectifie our Camp, and poſſeſs the
Woods and <hi>Avenues</hi> between <hi>Gemblours</hi> and our Camp; <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s
Brigade was detach'd at the ſame time to interline the
Right Wing of Horſe. The <hi>Heſſe</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> Troops
that had been detach'd from the <hi>Rhine</hi> by Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of
<hi>Baden,</hi> commanded by the Count <hi>de Lippe,</hi> (which we

and had paſs'd the <hi>Meuſe</hi> ſome Days before between
<hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and had halted to refreſh themſelves
between <hi>Huy</hi> and <hi>Namur</hi>) came up this Day, and incamp'd
upon our Right at St. <hi>Denis,</hi> a Village ſituated in the Skirts
of a Wood, near the Springs of the <hi>Mehaigne.</hi> The Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave
of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> who had come before to wait upon the
King in this Siege, put himſelf at the Head of his Troops
here, which were in a very fine and ſerviceable Condition,
both Foot, Horſe, and Dragoons, but eſpecially the Foot,
which made extraordinary good Battalions, very well
Cloath'd, and very good Men. At their coming, they
work'd at a very good Retrenchment to cover the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Plain, between the Wood of St. <hi>Denis</hi> upon the
Right, and that of <hi>Meux</hi> upon their Left.</p>
               <p>

between <hi>Seneff</hi> and <hi>Arkiennes,</hi> upon the River <hi>Senne,</hi> with
<hi>Nivelle</hi> before his Left: He was join'd here by the <hi>Rhine</hi>
Detachment, which we have brought in their way as far
as <hi>Rocroy,</hi> where they arriv'd the 7th. and being headed
by the <hi>Maréchal de Camp Pracontal,</hi> who was ſent from
<hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Army to meet them, he march'd them towards
the <hi>Sambre,</hi> which they paſs'd at <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> and join'd the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56660:74"/>
Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> this Day: And now having all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcements
he expected, and having a prodigious Army,
conſiſting of 119 Battalions and 235 Squadrons, 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to march the next Day to the Plains of <hi>Fleury,</hi> in
order to attempt the Relief of <hi>Namur.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſuch an Army, ſpoke of it as of a certain thing, and
began to maltreat ſtrangely our Priſoner-Garriſons of
<hi>Dixmuyde</hi> and <hi>Deinſe,</hi> to force them from our Service, as if
our Army had been loſt. 'Twas given out, that the Maré<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>de Villeroy</hi> had expreſs and poſitive Orders to attack us,
and the Devotions of the People were requir'd to implore
the divine Bleſſing. And here I cannot forbear mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Preface, the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Paris</hi> put to
their Mandate for the Prayers of 40 Hours, to be us'd in
that Dioceſs, (the See being now vacant) <hi>That as God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
Princes, who make War only to attack their Neighbours,
and make themſelves great; ſo he bleſſes thoſe who act only for the
defence of their People, and to procure Peace.</hi> Certainly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
muſt be very much put to it for want of a Preface, who
made this the <hi>French</hi> King's Caſe: For 'tis a very plain
Matter of Fact, that he himſelf has been the Aggreſſor in
this War, by attacking the Emperor, and the States; and
if other Princes have enter'd into an offenſive and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Alliance with them, it has been for their own neceſſary
Safety and Preſervation, which had ſuch a certain and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
dependance upon that of the Empire, and States of
the <hi>United Provinces.</hi> I do not know any Places where
the <hi>French</hi> King's Subjects have been attack'd, but by our
Sea-Bombardments; and in this caſe he has taken more
care to maintain his Conqueſts, than to defend his People.
If this Character is, or has been due to any Princes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in War, it is certainly to our King, who was now
engag'd in the Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> for no other Intereſt but
to eſtabliſh the Liberties of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> oppreſs'd by the
ambitious Greatneſs of our Enemies, who were ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching
upon their Neighbours, and had lately raviſh'd
this important Place out of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Hands.
He does not aggrandize his Dominions by it, and has no
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56660:74"/>
other Intereſt in it, but the glory of doing ſo much Good
to the World in general, and of eſtabliſhing the Welfare
and Security of his Subjects in particular, by the Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of this ſtrong Key of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
Thus much for this Preface. I believe the <hi>French</hi>
depended more upon the ſtrength and greatneſs of their
Army, than upon any Hopes the Dean and Chapter's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
could give them.</p>
               <p>The 16th. the Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> left the Camp of <hi>Seneff</hi>
and <hi>Nivelle:</hi> He commanded all the heavy Baggage away
to <hi>Mons,</hi> and march'd with the whole Army to the Plains
of <hi>Fleury,</hi> where he encamp'd with his Right between
St. <hi>Amand</hi> and <hi>Fleury,</hi> and his Left towards <hi>Sombref;</hi> the
head Quarter was at <hi>Marbais.</hi> At Night he caus'd about
50 Pieces of Cannon to be drawn at the Head of his Camp
upon the Cauſey that goes to <hi>Namur,</hi> which were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
round to give the Beſieged notice of his Arrival,
who now made every Night ſome Signals from the top of
the <hi>Cavalier</hi> of the <hi>Terra nova,</hi> with lighted Torches,
ſometimes Four, and Three, and Two, which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to ſignifie the time of the Reſiſtance they could
make. The Beſieged did not anſwer <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Signal,
and (as 'twas told after the Siege) did not hear it, the
Wind being contrary, tho' 'twas a ſtill Night. The
King, upon <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Approach with the <hi>French</hi> Army, left
his Quarter at <hi>Malogne,</hi> and the Siege of the Caſtle to the
Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Ploen,</hi> and
took his Quarter that very Night at the Caſtle of <hi>Boveſſe,</hi>
a Gentleman's Houſe, in the Rear of our Right Wing of
Horſe; but moſt of His Majeſty's Domeſticks remain'd
at the more convenient Quarter in the Abbey of <hi>Malogne.</hi>
The next Day the King was very early with Prince <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demont,</hi>
at his Quarter at <hi>Golſines,</hi> being then indiſpos'd,
which hinder'd him from waiting upon the King at his
own Quarter. Meaſures were then taken for the Security
of our Camp, by making Retrenchments where they
were requiſite. The King brought with him from the
Siege <hi>Velt-Maréchal-General Fleming,</hi> and Count <hi>d'Arco</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56660:75"/>
of the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> to command our Right-Wing of
Horſe; and <hi>Lumley</hi>'s Brigade of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe was detach'd
from the Left to the Right Wing, which was moſt expos'd
to the Enemy, to re-inforce it: They encamp'd at St. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
between the <hi>Heſſe</hi> Troops, and the Right of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which we advanc'd yet farther in the Front, and
drew our Line cloſer to the Woods and the <hi>Avenues</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. The ſame Day (17th.) the ſecond Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards, and the ſecond of <hi>Scots,</hi> which had
reliev'd ſome Days before my Lord <hi>Cuts</hi> his Battalion, and
the firſt Battalion of <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards, were countermanded
back to the Camp, and 12 Battalions more of the Elector
of <hi>Brandenbourgh</hi>'s and States Forces, beſides more of
the Horſe imploy'd in the Siege; ſo that 'twas computed
we had this Day 97 Battalions, and 237 Squadrons to
oppoſe to the Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> beſides about 30 Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions,
which continu'd the Siege, and Six in Garriſon
in the Town. This is the true ſtate of our Forces in
this great Conjuncture: and at this time 500 Men is the
moſt that we can rate a Battalion at, one with another, and
110 each Squadron in either Armies. I leave the Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Reader, and the difference of the two Armies
will appear upon it. This Day we began to work at
our Retrenchments, to fortifie the Houſe and Bridge
of <hi>Maſy;</hi> we made a Retrenchment at <hi>Boſſire</hi> before <hi>Fits-patrick</hi>
and <hi>Selwyn</hi>'s Brigades, which had before Prince
<hi>Vaudemont</hi>'s Quarter at <hi>Golſines</hi> in their Rear, and <hi>Boſſire</hi>
upon their Left; but upon the approach of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> they
chang'd their Ground, and encamp'd with their Right at
the Prince's Quarter, and Left towards the little River
which runs by <hi>Gemblours</hi> and <hi>Maſy</hi> to the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi>
in their Rear, their Line being perpendicular to the
Line of our Army: This Retrenchment defended the
Plain which runs with a Wood upon the Right, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the Left towards <hi>Conroy</hi> and <hi>Gemblours.</hi> Farther
towards <hi>Conroy</hi> we cut down Trees to barricade the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
and plac'd there a Captain and 60 Men, detach'd
out of the two 'fore-ſaid Brigades, with Orders to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56660:75"/>
the Poſt as long as poſſibly they could, to give notice
of the Enemies Approach: Theſe two Brigades were
then under the Command of Major-General <hi>Ramſay.</hi> The
ſame Day (17th.) Brigadier <hi>Fitspatrick</hi> was detach'd with
8 Battalions (3 whereof were <hi>Maitland, Tiffeny,</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon,</hi>
the reſt <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi>) to the Village of St. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
which lying upon the skirt of a Wood, they fortified
very ſtrongly. The <hi>Heſſians</hi> were more to the Right,
where they defended with a good Retrenchment the
little Plain between St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and <hi>Meux,</hi> ſituated on the
skirts of another Wood more towards the <hi>Mehaigne.</hi> Velt-Maréchal
<hi>Fleming,</hi> and Count <hi>d'Arco,</hi> with <hi>Lumley</hi>'s Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade,
and the <hi>Brandenbourgh</hi> Horſe, and <hi>Bavarian</hi> Cuiraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers,
were order'd more to the Right, between the Wood
of <hi>Meux,</hi> and the Village of <hi>Du,</hi> where they made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Retrenchment over the Plain, from the Wood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Left, to <hi>Du</hi> upon the Right. The <hi>Mehaigne</hi> has ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
little Springs, and ſome in this Place This was the

                  </gap>th. in the Army. As for
the Enemies, they did not march this Day, but continued
in their Camp between <hi>Fleury</hi> and <hi>Sombref;</hi> they had
made a conſiderable March the Day before with ſuch a
vaſt Body, that they halted this Day, to compleat their
Army, to Forrage, and give out Bread to the Soldiers.
The 18th. they march'd more upon their Left, towards
<hi>Gemblours,</hi> to come nearer to our Right, which was the
moſt open part of our Camp, our Left towards the <hi>Sambre</hi>
being very ſtrongly encamp'd, as we have deſcrib'd it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.
They encamp'd with their Right at <hi>Gemblours,</hi> and
Left at <hi>Grandléz,</hi> the head Quarter at <hi>Saunier:</hi> Upon
which Motion of the Enemy, Orders were given in our
Army not to ſtir out of the Camp, and every Body to be
ready at a Minute's warning, which ſhould be given by
the firing of three Pieces of Cannon. The ſame Day
(18th.) 22 Grenadiers <hi>per</hi> Company out of his Majeſty's
Forces, were order'd to be ready to march, and make an
Aſſault upon the Breach we had made in the <hi>Terra nova,</hi>
jointly with the reſt of the Beſiegers, who were to attack
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56660:76"/>
the Breach of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> and other Out-works: But his
Majeſty expecting the Enemies ſhould attack us the next
Day, thought it more convenient to deferr the Aſſault longer,
and in the mean while to widen and applaniſh the Breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
with the uſual violence of our Cannon, theſe Grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
being more neceſſary in our Camp at this time.
The Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> intended to attack us the next
Day, the King was inform'd of it, and the Army expected
it; for which Reaſon all Officers and Soldiers were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to lie in their Cloaths with their Arms, ready to
turn out upon call. Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> tho' very much
indiſpos'd, came by Three of the Clock in the Morning
in his Coach, and ſtood at the Head of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Guards,
notwithſtanding that he had kept his Bed Three or Four
Days before, and had then a Feaver upon him; the whole
Army turn'd out an Hour before Day. We form'd our
Battalions and Squadrons in a readineſs, and the King came
at the ſame time to ſee us in a poſture of defence, and went
in Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi>'s Coach to conferr with him upon the
preſent Conjuncture. The Weather was very thick and
foggy, ſo that we could hardly ſee 50 Yards before us, but
we had Out-guards all along beyond our Retrenchments,
to prevent any ſurprize; nevertheleſs we were very much
concern'd at the unſeaſonableneſs of the Fog, tho' 'twas
as inconvenient to the Enemy as to us. In the Morning,
the Brigade of Guards was commanded to the Right at
St. <hi>Denis,</hi> under the Command of Major General <hi>Churchil,</hi>
to form a Reſerve, and ſuſtain the Eight Regiments, that
had been poſted here under Brigadier <hi>Fitspatrick,</hi> which
were all freſh, and had not been concern'd in the Siege
of <hi>Namur.</hi> This was the moſt convenient Paſſage in our
Camp, and 'twas expected that the moſt vigorous Attack
of the Enemies would be here; therefore there was
a great deal of Care taken to fortifie all the <hi>Avenues,</hi>
and Church-yard of this Village. The Brigade of Guards
continu'd the Retrenchment from the Village within the
Hedges, and a marſhy bottom, by which they continu'd
it to the <hi>Heſſe</hi> Retrenchment. And we had now provided
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56660:76"/>
ſo well for the defence of this Paſſage, that we had no great
Apprehenſion of the Enemies coming here. The <hi>Heſſians</hi>
had made very good Batteries upon their Retrenchments
cover'd with <hi>Gabions,</hi> from whence they commanded the
whole Plain. There was another Paſſage to the Left of
St. <hi>Denis,</hi> about an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile before our Right Wing of
Horſe, which we retrench'd and fortify'd; and Sir <hi>David
Collier</hi> was poſted here with his Brigade and ſome Artillery:
We retrench'd all the Riſing Ground within <hi>Maſy</hi> and <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines,</hi>
and ſo to the Woods we had upon our Right. This
was the Poſture of our Camp this Day. The Enemies had
made ſeveral Motions the Night before, and this Morning
ſending ſeveral Bodies, ſometimes to their Right, and
ſometimes to their Left, and their whole Camp was under
Arms moſt part of the Night before, and this whole Day.
About Noon the Weather began to clear up, upon which
<hi>Villeroy</hi> advanc'd to St. <hi>Denis,</hi> to obſerve our Poſts and our
Army. We had barricaded the way through the Wood
with ſeveral Trees we had cut down; and the Boughs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thick and green, and there being a large Barn
hard by, he came by this way through the Wood, and
took the opportunity of this Cover, to come up cloſe to
this Retrenchment. As ſoon as he was perceiv'd, all our
Men within the Retrenchment took the Alarm, and ſtood
to their Arms, expecting it to be the Van-guard of the
Enemies Army: The King was at Dinner in his Tent,
which was pitch'd hard by for that purpoſe, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
got on Horſe-back to obſerve the Enemy: But
<hi>Villeroy</hi> finding himſelf diſcover'd, retir'd immediately,
having ſeen enough to convince him that 'twas not fit to
meddle with us here.</p>
               <p>The Day being paſs'd without any Action, and the Time
preſſing, (for now we began to wait in our Camp) the
King thought it not convenient to deferr the Aſſault of
the Breaches of the <hi>Terra nova,</hi> and <hi>Cohorne,</hi> any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
wherefore a Detachment was made this Evening
(19th.) of 36 Grenadiers <hi>per</hi> Company out of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of His Majeſty's Forces, which had not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56660:77"/>
in the Siege, and 18 out of thoſe that had been
employ'd in it. The Grenadiers of the Brigade of Guards
were commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Evans,</hi> Captain
of Grenadiers in the firſt Battalion; and the reſt by Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Epping,</hi> Colonel of one of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Battalions. But
before I proceed to give an Account of this Aſſault, it is
neceſſary to continue the Affairs of the Siege to this time.</p>
               <p>The 15th. as (we have ſaid it before) we took the Half-moon
of the <hi>Sambre,</hi> which would otherwiſe have flank'd
our Trenches, if we had not beat the Enemies from it, and
likewiſe our Aſſault upon the Breach of <hi>Terra nova.</hi> The
16th. being Maſters of this Half-moon, we began to work
at a Pattery of 10 Pieces of Cannon, upon the Left of
our inferiour Trench, between it and the Half-moon,
which fir'd upon the inward Face of the ſmall Baſtion,
at the Foot of the deſcending <hi>Courtin</hi> of <hi>Terra nova:</hi> Our
Batteries from the Town could only fire upon the outward
Face towards the <hi>Sambre;</hi> and beſides, this Battery firing
more perpendicular upon the Breach of <hi>Terra nova,</hi> had
yet a better effect than thoſe from the Town. Captain
<hi>Hart,</hi> of Colonel <hi>Courthop</hi>'s Regiment, was killed this Day
in the Trenches. In the Evening his Majeſty left the
Siege, to put himſelf at the Head of the Army, upon <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi>'s
Approach. Major-General <hi>Lindeboom</hi> reliev'd the
Trenches this Night, with the Prince of <hi>Holſtein Norbourg</hi>
Brigadier, and Colonel <hi>Mackay</hi> of our Forces. This
Night we advanc'd our Trenches between the ſide of the
<hi>Cohorne,</hi> and the <hi>Sambre.</hi> The Deſcent of the Hill from
the <hi>Cohorne</hi> to the <hi>Sambre</hi> being ſteep, this gave the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
opportunity to make uſe of a Machine to hinder our
Work; they fill'd ſome Casks with Powder, Bombs, and Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades,
with a Fuzee at each end of the Cask, which they
tumbl'd down the Hill upon our Men; but the Bombs and
Grenades being too heavy in the Casks for the Powder,
caus'd an unequal Motion of the Machine, which hinder'd
its Effect; for it could not roul down ſtrait, but inclin'd
either to the Right or to the Left, and if it fell <hi>per</hi> chance
among our Workmen, they only open'd to the Right and
Left, and let it run down the Hill, tho' at firſt it put them
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56660:77"/>
into ſome diſorder; but the Machine made more Noiſe
than Miſchief. The 17th. early in the Morning, our Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
of 10 Pieces of Cannon, upon the Left of our infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Trench, began to play with very good ſucceſs, and
contributed very much to level the Breach of the <hi>Terra
nova</hi> for a more eaſie Aſſault. By this time moſt of the
Enemies Cannon were diſmounted, except ſome great
Pieces upon the <hi>Cavalier</hi> of <hi>Terra nova,</hi> which could not
bear low enough upon us that attack'd from the bottom of
the Hill, and ſo did us no harm; but their Drakes were
ſtill troubleſome, which being light, they could eaſily
draw up and down where they were moſt convenient for
them. In the Afternoon we diſcover'd a Party of the
Enemies, of 20 Troopers from the Garriſon of <hi>Dinant,</hi>
which had poſted themſelves in Ambuſcade juſt by our
Line of Circumvallation towards the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> where a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
of the Elector's Guards were poſted, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd
them, killing 6 of the Enemy. and made the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Priſoner, and 7 more of his Party. In the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Major-General <hi>Swerin</hi> commanded the Trenches,
with Brigadier <hi>Dedem,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Friderick Hamilton.</hi>
The Breaches being now conſiderable, the Enemies work'd
hard every Night to make Retrenchments and <hi>Traverſes</hi>
within the Breaches of the <hi>Terra nova,</hi> and <hi>Cohorne:</hi> and
our Bombs playing without intermiſſion in theſe Works, did
(no doubt) kill them a great many Men. The 18th Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General
<hi>la Cave</hi> had the Trenches, and Brigadier <hi>Horne,</hi>
with Colonel <hi>Courthop</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Our Artillery from
all Parts continu'd its uſual Fury, and the Enemies, whilſt
we work'd in our Trenches, ſtill us'd their Machines to
interrupt our Men; they tumbl'd down Six Bombs this
Night, but with as little effect as before. The 19th. upon
expectation that the Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> would attack the
King's Army, the Elector waited upon his Majeſty: But
<hi>Villeroy</hi> having thought it more convenient to let it alone,
the King, with the Elector, and Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> and
other chief Generals, concerted the Aſſault for the next
Day.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Diſpoſition of this Attack was as follows:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MY Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> with 3000 <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was to attack
the Counterſcarp and Breach of the <hi>Terra nova,</hi>
and that part of the Line of Communication between
the <hi>Cohorne</hi> and the <hi>Terra nova,</hi> which was next to
the <hi>Terra nova.</hi> The Count <hi>de Rivera</hi> was to attack
the Breach of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> and that part of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
Line of Communication, next the <hi>Cohorne,</hi>
with 3000 <hi>Bavarians,</hi> and others. Major General
<hi>la Cave</hi> was to attack on the Right of Count <hi>Rivera,</hi>
(with 2000 <hi>Brandenburghers</hi>) the upper point of
the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> and part of the Communication to the
<hi>Caſotte.</hi> Major-General <hi>Swerin</hi> was to attack the
<hi>Caſotte</hi> with 2000 <hi>Dutch;</hi> and at the ſame a time,
Colonel was to attack the Lower Town with
600 Men. The Signal was to be a conſiderable
Quantity of Powder, blown-up upon the old Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
near the <hi>Bruſſels</hi> Port; and the Word of Battle,
given by the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> was <hi>God-with-us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Directions given by the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi>
to the aforeſaid General Officers, that were to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the reſpective Attacks in chief, were as
follows:</p>
               <p>That a certain Number of Men ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in each Attack upon the <hi>Forlorn-hope,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Number to ſuſtain them, and the reſt to be
upon the Reſerve; and as to Particulars, he left it to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56660:78"/>
each General Officer, commanding an Attack in
chief, to do as his own Judgment, and the Occaſion,
ſhould direct him; only it was order'd that Count
<hi>Rivera</hi>'s Attack, and thoſe upon the Right of him,
ſhould begin ſome Minutes before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Attack,
becauſe that was like to be the moſt difficult.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> the Night before the Attack,
receiv'd a Detachment from the King, of 1000 cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
Men, which were to be part of his 3000: For
His Majeſty was now at the head of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
Army, and had left my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that ſtay'd with the Duke of
<hi>Bavaria</hi> to carry on the Siege.</p>
               <p>It was order'd by the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the
Night before the Action, That all the Troops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
for the ſeveral Attacks, ſhould march into the
Trenches before Day, there to lie undiſcover'd till
the Hour of the Signal.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> in purſuance of this Order,
march'd into the Trenches with his Men ſome Hours
before Day; but there not being room enough to
cover all his Men, he was forced to place Three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
at the Abbey of <hi>Salſen,</hi> which was the
neareſt Place to the Trenches where they could lie
undiſcover'd.</p>
               <p>The Diſpoſition which my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> made for
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was as follows:</p>
               <p>He commanded 4 Sergeants, each with 15 Men,
(promiſing, in His Majeſty's Name, Advancement
to the Sergeants, and Rewards to the private Men,
if they did their Duty) to go upon the <hi>Forlorne
Hope:</hi> Theſe were to be follow'd by the Grenadiers
of the Guards, under the Command of Colonel
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56660:79"/>
                  <hi>Evans;</hi> and thoſe by the reſt of the Grenadeers,
deſign'd for the Attack of the Breach, making in
all 700, under the Command of a Colonel: 300
Grenadeers were order'd to attack the Line of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.
Colonel <hi>Courthop,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kay</hi>'s
Regiments, were order'd to ſuſtain thoſe that
attack'd the Breach: Colonel <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Buchan</hi>'s Regiments, were to make the Reſerve:
And that this might be the better perform'd, it was
order'd that the Regiments of <hi>Mackay, Hamilton,</hi>
and <hi>Buchan,</hi> which were plac'd at the Abbey of
<hi>Salſen,</hi> ſhould immediately after the Signal given;
march to the Place of Action, and draw up-behind
the Regiment of <hi>Courthop,</hi> there to receive further
Orders. About Noon, or ſoon after the Attack was
begun, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> marching out of the Trenches,
drew up under the Enemies Fire, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they had 900 Paces to march before they came
to the Breach, expos'd all the way to the Enemies
great and ſmall ſhot, which fir'd ſorely upon their
Flank all the way, they went on with a great deal
of firmneſs and reſolution. Immediately after the
Grenadeers follow'd Colonel <hi>Courthop</hi>'s Regiment,

                  </gap> of this Attack look'd very hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
but the Three Regiments at <hi>Salſen</hi> not march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo ſoon as was intended (either by a failure or
miſtake in the Signal) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops that were
already engag'd, were over-power'd by the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Enemies; and that which contributed to
their Misfortune, was the Count <hi>de Rivera</hi>'s being
ſhot dead upon the ſpot; the Count <hi>de Marſilly,</hi>
(who commanded the 600 Men that were to attack
the Line of Communication next the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Cohorne</hi>) with
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56660:79"/>
his Lieutenant-Colonel, being both immediately
ſhot dead; Colonel <hi>Courthop</hi> being likewiſe ſhot
dead, and his Lieutenant-Colonel, Sir <hi>Matthew Bridges,</hi>
deſperately wounded; moſt of the Officers of the
Grenadeers being kill'd or wounded, particularly
Captain <hi>Mitchel</hi> of the Guards ſhot dead, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Evans</hi> deſperately wounded; my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi>
receiving a ſhot in his Head, which diſabl'd him for
ſome time; the Count <hi>de Mercy,</hi> Colonel <hi>Windſor,</hi>
Colonel <hi>Stanhop,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> and ſeveral other
Gentlemen, who went Voluntiers with my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi>
in this Action, being wounded, and totally diſabled.
And Count <hi>Rivera</hi>'s Attack not beginning quite ſo
ſoon as was intended (by reaſon of the aforeſaid
Miſtake of the Signal) all the Fire of that part of
the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> which was next the <hi>Terra nova,</hi> fell
upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which had been otherwiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
if every thing, had ſucceeded as was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
After ſome time, the 3 Regiments from <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen</hi>
arriv'd; but things were then in ſuch a Poſture,
that they were forced to begin a new Attack, inſtead
of ſuſtaining that already begun: For Count <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi>
and Monſieur <hi>L'Abadié</hi> were by this time come
down, by Order of the Maréchal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> (as we
were afterwards inform'd by the <hi>French</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders)
in the ſpace which is between the <hi>Cohorne</hi> and
<hi>Terra nova,</hi> with 1200 Foot and Dragoons, all freſh
Men, whereof 200 were of the Dragoons of the <hi>French</hi>
King's Houſhold; and with theſe Troops they charg'd
our Forces in Flank and Rear, which were already in
the middle of 6 different Fires. The Battalions from
<hi>Salſen,</hi> tho' they came too late to do us the Service
intended, did not want their ſhare of ſuffering, as
appears by the Liſt of their kill'd and wounded Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Soldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:56660:80"/>
By this time my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> being dreſs'd of his Wounds,
and come to himſelf, finding the Affair of the <hi>Terra nova</hi>
not poſſibly to be retriev'd, and obſerving the <hi>Bavarians,</hi>
upon Count <hi>Rivera</hi>'s Attack, engag'd in a very hot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ire,
who (notwithſtanding Count <hi>Rivera</hi> was kill'd, and the
Prince of <hi>Holſtem Norburg</hi> Brigadier, wounded; and that
moſt of the Officers of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Guards, and other
Regiments, were kill'd and wounded) had fix'd themſelves
upon the outermoſt Retrenchment of the Point of the <hi>Cohorne</hi>
next to the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and maintain'd the Poſt with a great
deal of obſtinacy, but could not gain any more Ground;
order'd 200 Men to be detach'd out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops,
and that none ſhould be choſen, but ſuch as were reſolv'd
to carry their Point or dye by it, upon Promiſe of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
Rewards to ſuch as ſhould do any extraordinary
Action; and ordering thoſe to be ſuſtain'd by the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Mackay,</hi> and that the other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces ſhould
rally and come after as ſoon as they could, he reſolv'd to
bend his whole Force, to make good the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Attack:
And as ſoon as he was come to the Place of Action, he
detach'd Lieutenant <hi>Cockle,</hi> of <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Regiment, with a
Party of choſen Men, with the following Orders:</p>
               <p>That he ſhould attack the Face of the <hi>ſaillant Angle,</hi> next
to the Breach, Sword in Hand, without firing a Shot,
that he ſhould paſs the Paliſſades, and enter the cover'd
way; That if he could not maintain the Poſt, he ſhould
make the beſt Retreat he could with his Men, but that he
ſhould lodge himſelf, if he found any Place capable of
it, with a Promiſe, in his Majeſty's Name, of a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
Reward if he ſucceeded, and out-liv'd it. At
the ſame time he commanded the Enſigns of <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
to march ſtrait to the Paliſſades, and plant their
Colours upon 'em, with Promiſes of ſutable Rewards. All
this ſucceeded ſo well, that Lieutenant <hi>Cockle</hi> entring the
Paliſades, beat the Enemy from the cover'd way, and
lodg'd himſelf in a Battery of theirs, having firſt turn'd
their own Cannon upon them, for which his Majeſty has
ſince rewarded him with Advancement and Money. Whilſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56660:80"/>
Colonel <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Enſigns were advancing to the Paliſſades,
the <hi>Bavarians</hi> renew'd their Attack with undaunted Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giour,
(tho', as was ſaid before, moſt of their Officers
were kill'd and wounded) and ſo this Poſt was made good.</p>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> expos'd himſelf to a degree not
to be imagin'd, going from Place to Place, to obſerve what
paſs'd, and give ſuch Orders as he thought fit, ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
being kill'd and wounded very near him; he gave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Handfuls of Gold to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers, as well as
his own, and ſaying many kind things of the Bravery both
of the Officers and Soldiers. No Gentleman ever fell
more generally lamented, than Colonel <hi>Courthop</hi> did on
this Occaſion, giving all poſſible Hopes of an extraordinary
Man in the Military Art, if he had liv'd. Colonel <hi>Windſor,</hi>
Colonel <hi>Stanhop,</hi> the Count <hi>de Mercy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tomſon,</hi> (eldeſt
Son to Sir <hi>John Tomſon</hi>) and other Gentlemen of Note be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mention'd,
behav'd themſelves on this Occaſion with
all the Bravery it was poſſible for Men to ſhew. And
many other remarkable Actions were done by ſeveral of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> too many to ſet down here.</p>
               <p>Having gain'd the Cover'd way before the Breach of the
<hi>Cohorne,</hi> and the inferiour <hi>Angle ſaillant,</hi> or Point towards
the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and our Troops being fatigu'd by ſo long an
Aſſault, and the Enemies Reſiſtance, we contented our
ſelves to make a Lodgment here without any farther At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon the Breach. Upon this Re-inforcement of
the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Bavarians,</hi> at this Attack, by my Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi>
and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops under his Command, the Enemies
were ſo employ'd in the defence of this moſt dangerous
Poſt, as very much facilitated Major-General <hi>la Cave</hi>'s
Enterprize upon the Cover'd-way before the <hi>Ravelin,</hi> and
upper Point of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> and ſo on towards the <hi>Caſotte,</hi>

and made a very good Lodgment all along this
Cover'd-way and Retrenchment, of about 300 Paces,
which he extended to the Left, turning in towards the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne,</hi>
about 140 Paces more, to join it to that of Major-General
<hi>la Cave,</hi> which reached to the <hi>Ravelin</hi> of the
<hi>Cohorne.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Bavarians</hi> (commanded at firſt by
Major-General <hi>Rivera</hi>) carry'd it to the <hi>Angle ſaillant,</hi> or
inferior Point of the <hi>Cohorne</hi> towards the <hi>Sambre;</hi> and our
rally'd Forces continu'd it to the other ſide of this Angle
before the Breach, ſo that we were now Maſters of one
of the greateſt Lodgments that ever have been made in
one Aſſault, being near an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile in length. Tho'
we miſcarried in the great Deſign of this general Storm,
(which was to have taken the Caſtle, with all its prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Outworks, by aſſault) for want of a due Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
among our ſeveral Attacks, either by the Failure or
Miſtake of the Signals. Such a vaſt Lodgment could not
be done in a moment, the Aſſault laſted till the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor could it be gain'd without Loſs. I have not

and Soldiers, kill'd and wounded, being join'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
amounts to 1028. beſides the Grenadiers, which,
I'm ſure, had near 300 kill'd and wounded: So that the
whole Loſs of His Majeſty's Forces, concern'd in this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
amounted to about 1400 Men; tho' moſt Prints,
that ſpeak of this Buſineſs, make the whole Loſs of the
Allies to come to little more than this. 'Tis true, that the
other Forces concern'd in the Attacks of the <hi>Cohorne</hi> and
<hi>Caſotte,</hi> did not ſuffer near ſo much as we did, or rather,
their Loſs was but inconſiderable, except the <hi>Dutch</hi> and
<hi>Bavarians,</hi> employ'd in the Attack of the Breach of the
<hi>Cohorne,</hi> under Major-General <hi>Rivera,</hi> who had many,
both Officers, and Soldiers, kill'd and wounded; and if
the Loſs of all the reſt of the Allies put together be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
equal to that we ſuſtain'd, we muſt have had in all,
kill'd and wounded in this Action, near 3000 Men. We
had a great many Voluntiers to ſignalize themſelves in
this Occaſion. If I could have got a Liſt of all theſe
worthy Gentlemen, I would have mention'd them in
this Place. What Loſs the Enemies ſuſtain'd, particularly
in this Attack, is not known, no more than in any of the
others; but we need not doubt, but ſuch an Attack, which
laſted ſo long, and where our Bombs play'd at the ſame time
inceſſantly in their Works, muſt deſtroy them a great many
Men. This Night, (30th.) Major-General <hi>Arnheim</hi> had
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56660:82"/>
the Trenches, with the Prince of <hi>Anhalt</hi> Brigadier. We
work'd all Night to ſtrengthen and fortifie the great
Lodgment we had made the Day before.</p>
               <p>To return to the two Armies, in preſence of one
another; the one to endeavour to relieve the Beſieged,
and the other to cover the Beſiegers. <hi>Villeroy</hi> had been
the Day before, to viſit our Poſts at St. <hi>Denis;</hi> and
though he began then to apprehend the great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
there was to attack us in our ſtrong Poſts,
and the apparent Hazard of a Battel, yet to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
all Ways poſſible to relieve the Place, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the Army in the Morning, (20th.) to march
upon the Left towards <hi>Perwys,</hi> to try a Paſſage at the
Springs of the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> the Country being more
open thereabouts. The King, who expected this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Enemies, order'd in the Morning our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
of the Right, under the Command of Velt-Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>Fleming,</hi> and Count <hi>d' Arco,</hi> with <hi>Lumley</hi>'s Brigade,
to march on upon the Right towards the <hi>Mehaigne:</hi>
The <hi>Heſſe</hi> Troops made the ſame Motion, and they all
encamp'd with a Wood upon their Right, their Left to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Village of <hi>Du,</hi> and that of <hi>Ypigny</hi>'s before
them. Lieutenant-General <hi>la Foreſt</hi> was detach'd at
the ſame time with 20 Squadrons of Horſe to <hi>Taviers</hi>
and <hi>Bonef,</hi> upon the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> to obſerve the Enemies
March, who came early in the Afternoon to their
Camp near the <hi>Mehaigne.</hi> Lieutenant-General <hi>la Foreſt</hi>
continu'd in his Poſt, till the Left Wing of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Horſe (which, upon this March, had the Van of
the Army) was come up to the Ground, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it ſelf along the River, between <hi>Ramelies,</hi> and
<hi>Harlue,</hi> and <hi>Taviers,</hi> upon the <hi>Mehaigne.</hi> As ſoon as the
Left Wing was come up, they detach'd about 40 Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of Horſe and Dragoons, to beat us out of the
Poſt of <hi>Bonef:</hi> But <hi>la Foreſt,</hi> who was here poſted, had
Orders not to diſpute it, but only to obſerve the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56660:83"/>
March, and abandon it; the Enemies being ſo near,
and ſo much ſuperior to him in number, this occaſion'd
ſome diſorder in his Retreat. The Detachment of <hi>Dopf,</hi>
and <hi>Eppinger</hi>'s Dragoons, that had been poſted in ſome
Hedges, to make good our Retreat, were forc'd out
of it; and the Enemies having gain'd the Paſs, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to flank our Horſe, which march'd off in two
Columns, and to ſurround them with their Line of
Squadrons: However, after ſome Skirmiſhes on both
ſides, our Cavalry made their Retreat good. Major
<hi>Crowther</hi> commanded a Squadron of Brigadier <hi>Lumley</hi>'s
Regiment in this occaſion, with which he fac'd about in
the Retreat, and with ſome others skirmiſh'd with the
Enemies. The <hi>French</hi> expected that this would bring
both Armies to a Battel, and the Princes of the Blood
put themſelves at the Head of the Cavalry, to ſhew a
good Example in ſo important an Action. The Duke
<hi>du Maine</hi> had a Horſe kill'd under him; the Marquis
<hi>de Villequier</hi> was dangerouſly wounded. On our ſide,
the Major of <hi>Eppinger</hi>'s Dragoons was kill'd, and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<hi>Alexander,</hi> of Brigadier <hi>Lumley</hi>'s Regiment, was
made Priſoner, and we loſt about 10 Horſes. The
<hi>French</hi> made much of this inconſiderable Succeſs; an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
was immediately diſpatch'd, to give an Account of
it to Court. They had already broke in upon our
Right Wing of Horſe; and nothing leſs was expected
by the next Courier, than the Defeat and Rout of our
Army, and the Relief of <hi>Namur;</hi> nay, the thing was
thought ſo ſure, that 'twas immediately communicated
to Foreign Miniſters, as 'tis credibly reported. This alſo
contributed very much to the Oppreſſion of our <hi>Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muyde</hi>
and <hi>Deinſe</hi> Priſoners, who were now very ill
treated and abuſed; though afterwards the Pretext was
for Repriſal of their Sick and Wounded in the Town of
<hi>Namur,</hi> which they pretended were not well us'd among
us. Some of the moſt hot-Headed of our National
Enemies abroad, would then tell the Soldiers, to terrifie
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56660:83"/>
them, That they muſt not expect to be treated as Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of War, but as Rebels. But this was making a
Triumph before the Victory, as it prov'd to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>The King being inform'd of the Enemies March up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Left, towards <hi>Perwys,</hi> order'd the Army to
march upon the Right, at the ſame time that our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
were engag'd in the Aſſault againſt the Caſtle and
Outworks The King took his Quarter this Day at a
Gentleman's Houſe, call'd <hi>Oſtin,</hi> near the Village of <hi>Du.</hi>
The Brigade of Guards being now in the Reſerve, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
upon the Right of the King's Quarter, in a
third Line, near the <hi>Heſſe</hi> Troops: Our Body of Foot
encamp'd within the Retrenchment of <hi>Du,</hi> and our
Cavalry encamp'd behind them, to ſuſtain the Foot in
the defence of the Retrenchments. We abandon'd the
perpendicular Retrenchment at <hi>Boſſire,</hi> between <hi>Maſy</hi>
and <hi>Gemblours. Livingſton</hi>'s Dragoons, with the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Foot, of <hi>Holſtein Ploen,</hi> was left to guard the Poſt
of <hi>Maſy:</hi> my Lord <hi>George Hamilton</hi> Brigadier, was left to
guard the Retrenchment of <hi>Golſines,</hi> with three Battalions.
This was made upon the quitting of the Retrenchment of
<hi>Boſſire,</hi> leaving <hi>Golſines</hi> (Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi>'s Quarter) before
it, who was Quarter'd at <hi>Oſtin,</hi> in the ſame Houſe with
His Majeſty. Brigadier <hi>Fitspatrick</hi> continu'd with his
Eight Battalions at St. <hi>Denis.</hi> We had a good Body
of Horſe poſted at <hi>Ypignies</hi> before our Right. At our
coming to this Ground, we ſaw the Enemies encamp'd
with their Left near the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> between <hi>Ramelies</hi> and
<hi>Taviers,</hi> and their Right ſtretching towards <hi>Orbais,</hi> with
<hi>Perwys</hi> before them, and <hi>Malevre</hi> in their Rear. At
Night we continu'd our Retrenchment from <hi>Du,</hi> to the
Wood upon our Right, to be defended by the <hi>Heſſe</hi>
Troops, and ſome of the Body of Foot.</p>
               <p>The 21ſt. we continu'd our Fire againſt the Caſtle
with the uſual Fury, to make all Things ready for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Aſſault. We began to apply the Miner to the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56660:84"/>
Breach of the <hi>Cohorne;</hi> for our Cannon firing from the
Town, and the other ſide of the River up the Hill,
could only break down the upper part of the Work,
whilſt the Foot of it remain'd entire under the Shot of our
Cannon; and beſides, having gain'd the Counterſcarp
of this Work, our Cannon could not play againſt the
<hi>Cohorne,</hi> without doing harm to our own Men: And
this I ſuppoſe was the Reaſon why we deſign'd in the
laſt Attack to carry the Counterſcarp and Breach all at
once. At Night Major-General <hi>Lindeboom</hi> mounted the
Trenches, with Brigadier <hi>Dedem.</hi> The ſame Day, the
Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> paſs'd the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> with a good
Body of Horſe, and advanc'd as far as <hi>Ypignies.</hi> The
grand Guard we had here, retreated to the Camp upon
his Approach, their Orders being not to engage. The
Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> left the main of his Body of Horſe,
and rid on, full ſpeed, with two Squadrons of <hi>Huſſars,</hi>
(whoſe Horſes are very fleet, and fit for ſuch a purpoſe)
cloſe to our Retrenchments, upon our Right, to view
our Works, and to obſerve our Camp: He continued
here, wheeling ſometime to the Right, and ſometime
to the Left, near a little Hedge that cover'd him. We
brought down ſome Pieces of Cannon to fire upon him,
which as ſoon as he perceiv'd it, he rid off full ſpeed with his
two Squadrons under the ſhelter of a Wood we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Heſſe</hi> Retrenchment. At the ſame time that
we brought down our Cannon, we drew up ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of Foot within our Line, expecting the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
but no Action happen'd, only ſome <hi>pickeering</hi> (as
they term it;) that is, when ſingle Men detach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
voluntarily from both ſides, to meet and fire upon
one another, and then retire to their ſeveral Bodies again.
The Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> having obſerv'd the Poſture of
our Camp, and our ſtrong Retrenchments, rid back
again full ſpeed with his <hi>Huſſars,</hi> to the main Body of
Horſe he had left at the heighth of <hi>Ypignies.</hi> We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd
ſome Squadrons after him, the grand <hi>Mouſquetaires</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:56660:84"/>
of <hi>Brandenbourgh</hi> being one of them; but without any
other Action, than the former <hi>Pickeering. Villeroy</hi>
having found us ſo well poſted in this Place, would
yet try to find out a Paſſage for the Relief of
<hi>Namur,</hi> between our Right and the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> and
therefore he went with his Detachment of <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars,</hi>
towards the Village of <hi>Verderin,</hi> where there is
another narrow Plain upon the skirt of a thick Wood,
which from hence continues to the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> The Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
of <hi>Dopf</hi> and <hi>Eppinger</hi> were poſted here, where
they made a Retrenchment; and the Cavalry of
the Right was commanded this Day, with <hi>Lumley</hi>'s
Brigade, to join theſe Dragoons, for the Defence of
this Poſt, with <hi>Collier</hi>'s Brigade, which hitherto had
continu'd in the little Retrenchment, in the Wood
between St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and <hi>Golſines.</hi> Thus <hi>Villeroy</hi> found
all the Paſſages guarded before the Town from the
<hi>Sambre,</hi> where the River of <hi>Maſy</hi> falls into it, by all
theſe Villages we have mention'd, round to the <hi>Meuſe</hi>
below <hi>Namur,</hi> at our Bridge of Communication;
making, with Woods, Rivulets, and Retrenchments, a
kind of an outer Line of Circumvallation, near
Twelve <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles in length. And this was thought
a better Defence, than to have diſputed the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of the <hi>Mehaigne</hi> to the Enemies, when they came
to <hi>Perwys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although <hi>Villeroy</hi> had now loſt all Hopes of doing any
thing for the Relief of the Caſtle, for he found
that he could not attack us without hazarding the
Loſs of his whole Army, and that ours was in a good
Condition, and ſtrongly poſted, (and indeed our
Strength was ſuch, that, I believe, had not the Siege
of the Caſtle depended upon the Iſſue of a Battel,
we ſhould hardly have put a Spade in the Ground
to have made a Retrenchment) yet the Enemies
Preſence at <hi>Perwys</hi> was very inconvenient to our
Army, which was now ſhut up in a kind of a Line
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56660:85"/>
of Circumvallation, where Forage was very ſcarce:
They had cut off all Communication with <hi>Bruſſels</hi>
and <hi>Louvain,</hi> from whence we had our Proviſions:
They were now Maſters of the River-ſide, between
<hi>Namur</hi> and <hi>Liege,</hi> ſo that we could have nothing from
thence by Water, but muſt be brought by Land,
on the <hi>Dinant</hi> ſide, through a difficult Country. But
the Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> had ſecur'd his Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with <hi>Charleroy</hi> and <hi>Mons,</hi> by leaving the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>de Harcourt</hi> with a ſmall Army near <hi>Fleury:</hi>
From whence it appears, that if the <hi>French</hi> had
not left the Caſtle to the laſt Extremity, before they
came to Relieve it, it might have prov'd of a very
dangerous Conſequence to our Army, which would
have been in a manner depriv'd of Subſiſtance for
Man and Horſe. But they muſt bombard <hi>Bruſſels</hi>
firſt, and ſo they came too late; and I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the Reaſon of this Proceeding, unleſs they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
all the Reports of our Loſſes, publiſh'd in the
<hi>Paris Gazette;</hi> and ſo to let the Siege run on, to ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our Army, and then to come at laſt with their
Army, to give the finiſhing Stroke to our Ruine.
If they ſay, their <hi>Rhine</hi> Detachment was not yet
come up, ours had not join'd us neither, and ſo
there had ſtill been the ſame Proportion between
the two Armies. Though we began to want at
this time, yet our Soldiers ſuffer'd it with a great
Conſtancy, and few or none deſerted to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Upon the Maréchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi>'s poſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
near the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> a Re-inforcement of Horſe
and Foot was ſent to <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> commanded by the Marquis <hi>de Bedmar,</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:56660:85"/>
The <hi>22th,</hi> in the Morning the Thunder of our Canons conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
againſt the Caſtle, and we were working hard to bring our
Mine to perfection under the breach of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> when about
Noon the Beſieged beat a Parley to bury the Dead which had been
killed in the Aſſault the <hi>20th.</hi> which began to ſtink and incommode
them very much: A Ceſſation was agreed upon for Two
Hours to bury the Dead: But the Beſieged finding that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rechal
<hi>de Villeroy</hi> could not relieve them; that they had already
ſuſtain'd a deſperate Aſſault; that we had made a great Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the Cover'd way of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> and <hi>Caſotte;</hi>
that the <hi>Cohorne</hi> could not hold out anothet Aſſault, and the
breach of the <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> which was wholly commanded by
it was not then defenſible; that the Soldiers were reduc'd to eat
Horſe-Fleſh; (For though at the beginning, when <hi>Athlone</hi> was
marching to inveſt the place, they had brought in all the Cattle
of the Countrey round about, yet it being Salted in haſt, and in
the Heat of Summer, when they came to make uſe of it in the
Siege of the Caſtle, it was ſo corrupted, that they were forced
to throw it away, and to prefer Horſe-Fleſh before it,) and
that the whole Garriſon was extreamly fatigu'd by their long
Service in this Siege, and by the fury of our Boombs which fell
in their Works without ceaſing: For theſe reaſons they reſolv'd
to Capitulate and Surrender the Place: The Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi>
came upon the Breach a little before the Ceſſation was over, and
called for the Major General of the Trenches, who was then
<hi>Lindeboom,</hi> and told him that he deſir'd to ſpeak with the Elector.
Count <hi>Verita</hi> one of the Gentlemen to his Electoral Highneſs was
then in the Trenches, and he immediately gave notice of it to the
Elector, who thereupon came to the Breach. Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi>
at firſt offered to ſurrender the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> but the Elector refu'sd
to Capitulate for any part, but for the whole: The Count
<hi>de Guiſcard</hi> replyed that the Marechal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> Commanded
in the Caſtle, and that he would let him know it; and in the
mean while deſired the Ceſſation to be continued. The Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>de Boufflers</hi> conſented to ſurrender the whole upon Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Terms, and the Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi> came back to the Breach
of the <hi>Cohorne</hi> to acquaint the Elector with it, The White Flag
was immediately put up upon the Breach, and Hoſtages exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56660:86"/>
which for the Beſieged were Monſieur <hi>de l' Abadie</hi> Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
and the Count <hi>de Monthron</hi> Colonel of the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Foot; and for us, Major General <hi>La Cave,</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Frederick Hamilton,</hi> who had been lightly wounded in the
Aſſault, and Baron <hi>Meyer</hi> one of the Electors Miniſters was ſent
in to manage the Capitulation. An Expreſs was immediately
diſpatch'd to give Notice of it to the King at <hi>Oſtin:</hi> But His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was then coming to the Siege with Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> in his
Coach to order a ſecond Aſſault, and the Expreſs met His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
in the way. The Capitulation was agreed upon, and Sign'd
that very Night. The Count <hi>d' Guiſcard</hi> obliged the Marechal
<hi>d' Boufflers</hi> to Sign it, becauſe he had Commanded in the Caſtle
during the Siege; but the Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi> had only Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the <hi>Cohorne</hi> and Out-works, and ſo could not Sign for the
Surrender of the Caſtle; and this I believe is the firſt Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that has been Sign'd by a Marechal of <hi>France,</hi> which was as
follows.</p>

               <p>That Evening the Caſtle Capitulated, Orders were given in
His Majeſties Camp for all Officers to lye in their Cloaths, and
the Soldiers the ſame, with their Arms ready; and the <hi>Bywacht</hi>
or Camp-Guard of a Captain, Lieutenant, Enſign, and 60 Men
<hi>per</hi> Batallion was commanded to reinforce our Poſt at <hi>Maſy,</hi> then
defended by <hi>Levingſton</hi>'s Dragoons, and the Regiment of Foot
of <hi>Holſtein-Ploen:</hi> This was to prevent all manner of ſurprize
from the Enemies, who upon the news of the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation
might have preſum'd upon our negligence, to
fall upon us, or might have been prompted to it by their own
deſpair, to give this laſt endeavour to have this Important Place;
but we did not find it, ſo we paſt the Night quietly. The <hi>23d.</hi>
in the Morning we took poſſeſſion of the <hi>Cohorne, Redoubt,</hi> with
the <hi>Caſematte, Caſotte,</hi> &amp;c. according to the Capitulation Sign'd
over Night. The Marechal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> having notice of the
Capitulation, was extremely concern'd at it, and was ſome
Hours without admitting any Body to ſee him; It is probable
he did not hear of it before this Morning; for great part of the
Army was gone to Forrage this day: The Marechal would not
be a Witneſs to our Rejoycing for this great Conqueſt, but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
in the Afternoon from <hi>Perwys</hi> and <hi>Grand Roſiers</hi> to march
back upon his Right to <hi>Sombref,</hi> and the Plaine of <hi>Fleury,</hi> which
he did all Night with ſuch haſte and precipitation, that he left
many Forragers and Out-guards behind him. This Evening we
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56660:88"/>
had a <hi>Feu de Joy</hi> in our Camp for the taking of the Caſtle of
<hi>Namur,</hi> which being diſpers'd in the ſeveral Poſts along our
Retrenchments from <hi>Maſy</hi> to the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> the confuſion of the
Fire from ſo many places was really agreeable, and the triple
Diſcharge of our Small Shot ſeem'd to be but one of a long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance:
Our Artillery was drawn from all the Poſts upon a
Line behind the Kings Quarter, conſiſting of 56 Pieces of <hi>Engliſh,
10 Dutch,</hi> 10 of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and 10 of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> in all 86 Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

The <hi>25th.</hi> the Marechal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> paſſed the <hi>Sambre</hi> at

The ſame Day, the Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi> Governour of <hi>Namur</hi>
Din'd with the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> at His Graces Quarter. Whilſt
the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> was Priſoner at <hi>Namur</hi> after the Battle of
<hi>Landen,</hi> they contracted a Reciprocal Eſteem and Friendſhip,
which muſt needs be very great, being grounded upon ſo much
Worth and Generoſity on both ſides. In the Evening Major-General
<hi>Churchill</hi> was commanded with Twenty Batallions to
Encamp within the Line of Circumvallation between <hi>Maiſon
Rouge</hi> (the Kings Quarter during the Siege of the Town of
<hi>Namur</hi>) and the Town: All the Regiments employed in the
Siege of the Caſtle Incamp'd within the Stone-Line between the

                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:56660:89"/>
this Detachment was made to Reinforce our Troops there, in
caſe of any Oppoſition from the Garriſon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>26th.</hi> being the Day prefix'd for the marching out of the
Garriſon four Brigades of Foot were commanded to make a
Lane, drawing up on both ſides from the Breach of <hi>Terra Nova</hi>
up the Hill, and ſo down again to the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> to the way that
leads to <hi>Givet; Colliers</hi> Brigade had the Right next to the <hi>Meuſe,</hi>
the reſt being <hi>Dutch.</hi> A Bridge of Boats was made upon the
<hi>Sambre</hi> between the <hi>Fauxbourg, St. Croix</hi> and the Town for
His Majeſty to come over to be preſent at the marching out of
the Garriſon; and likewiſe for the Troops Incamped on the
other ſide, if there had been occaſion. About Ten of the
Clock the Garriſon began to march out of the Breach: The
Marechal <hi>de Bouffler</hi>'s <hi>Guards du Corps</hi> march'd out firſt, and
then the Marechal's Domeſticks; The Marechal himſelf fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with the Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi> Governour, at the Head of
as many of the <hi>King</hi>'s and <hi>Alfeld</hi>'s Dragoons as were Mounted,
being between Seventy or Eighty: His Majeſty was on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
with the Elector before the Breach; the Mareſchal and the
Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi> Saluted at the Head of the Garriſon on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
with their Swords. Monſieur <hi>Dickvelt</hi> having been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Marechal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> in his Embaſſyes in
<hi>France</hi> Accoſted him, and Rid with him to the top of the Hill,
where Monſieur <hi>de L' Etang</hi> Brigadier of the Brigade of Life-Guard
rid up to the Marechal, with about Twelve Gentlemen
of the Life-Guard, and Arreſted him in His Majeſties Name for
Satisfaction for the Garriſons of <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> and <hi>Deinſe,</hi> Detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſtill Priſoners by the <hi>French</hi> King contrary to the <hi>Cartel.</hi>
The Marechal was very much Incens'd at firſt with our Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
alledging the Publick Faith of the Capitulation, wherein he
was expreſly mentioned: That the <hi>French</hi> King his Maſter would
reſent this Treatment to a Man of his Character, and revenge it
to the utmoſt of his Power, and that for his part he had defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the place like a Man of Honour, and did not deſerve it;
To which Monſieur <hi>Dickvelt</hi> replyed, That the <hi>French</hi> King, by
his little regard to Capitulations, and particularly to that of
<hi>Dixmuyde</hi> and <hi>Deynſe</hi> had forced us to this way of demanding
Satisfaction for the infraction of theſe Capitulations, That if
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56660:89"/>
he was Arreſted, 'twas not out of any diſreſpect to his Perſon
and Character; On the contrary, That when 'twas propoſed to
His Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to retain the whole Garriſon by way
of Reprizal: The King expreſſed ſo much value for his Perſon,
that he look'd upon him as ſufficient Caution to anſwer for Six
Thouſand Men, the Number of the Two Garriſons of <hi>Dixmude</hi>
and <hi>Deinſe:</hi> And at the ſame time offer'd him his Liberty by His
Majeſties Order, if he would paſs his word for the ſending back
the ſaid Garriſons, or return himſelf Priſoner within a Fortnight,
<hi>or words to this effect;</hi> The Mareſchal anſwered, <q>That he could
not paſs his word of Honour in a Matter which he could not
execute himſelf, that it was in vain for him to reſiſt:</q> And ſo
he put up his Sword, and went back with his Domeſticks to
<hi>Namur,</hi> where he was detained Priſoner, and treated with all
the Honour due to his Character, and to a Marechal of <hi>France:</hi>
A Captain Lieutenant and Enſign mounted the Guard upon his
Quarter with Colours, and beat a March to him, and ſaluted him
when he went abroad, having the Liberty of the Town upon his
word. The Garriſon marched on with the Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi>
at the Head of it, in this order, The Dragoons of the Kings
and <hi>Asfeld</hi>'s Regiments (as many as were mounted) on Horſeback,
preceeded by <hi>Boufflers</hi> Life-Guards: Next followed the
Infantry of the Garriſon which march'd out in this Order, One
Battallion of <hi>Nice,</hi> then One of <hi>Navar,</hi> then Three of <hi>Piemont</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally,
One of <hi>La Marre,</hi> One of <hi>Foix,</hi> One of <hi>Court Swiſſe,</hi> One
of <hi>Solre:</hi> Then the Independent Companies marched in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Foot, followed by a Battallion of <hi>Haynault,</hi> One of
<hi>Bugey,</hi> Two of <hi>Maulevrier</hi> ſeverally, One of <hi>Beauvoiſis,</hi> Two
of <hi>Dauphin, Salade</hi> together; and Three more Battallions of
<hi>Dauphin</hi> ſeverally; In all 19 Battallions. The Dragoons on
Foot follow'd in this Order, <hi>Du Barreau, Asfeld Eſtranger,
de Ganges, St. Hermine, Gramont, Quelus, Dauphin,</hi> and the
<hi>King's,</hi> brought up by Monſieur <hi>de L' aumont,</hi> Lieutenant-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour:
All the Officers were very deſirous to ſee the King in
Marching out, asking where the King was, and they ſaluted
with their Pikes and Portuiſanes the King and the Elector,
who ſtood by one another. The Artillery granted by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation,
and Wagons, march'd out of the Lower Town by
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56660:90"/>
the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and the Horn-work of <hi>Bulè,</hi> with the Battallion of
Fuziliers, the Gunners, Miners, Pioneers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Four Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades
above-mentioned ſtill ſtanding to their Armes, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that had taken poſſeſſion of the <hi>Cohorne, Redoubt, Caſotte,</hi> &amp;c.
And by Four in the Afternoon the whole Place was evacuated,
and delivered up into our hands. The Battallions which march'd
out of the Breach according to the Liſt which I have ſeen and caſt
up, made 3867 Effective Men, and the Dragoons 1085, which
in all amounts to 4942 Men, Foot and Dragoons, beſides the
Independant Companies, and the Battallion of Fuſiliers, which
march'd out of the Gate by the <hi>Meuſe</hi> with the Artillery, all which
ſuppoſing to amount to 500 Men, with the Gunners, Miners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
muſt make the Garriſon marching out to be 5442 Effective Men;
which being deducted from 12000 Effective under Armes at the
beginning of the Siege, makes the loſs of the Beſieged to amount
to 6558 Men killed, wounded, and deſerted, ſuppoſing the
Garriſon to have been at firſt but 12000 Effective Men. As for
the Loſſes of the Allies in this Siege, I could not get an Exact
Calculation of it; and therefore ſhall paſs it over; but by the
beſt accounts I could ſee, it did not come up to the double of the
Loſs of the Beſieged.</p>
               <p>The Garriſon being all marched out, the <hi>Spaniſh Terces</hi> (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments)
of <hi>Manriques</hi> and <hi>Marino,</hi> which had been ſent from
<hi>Bruſſels</hi> for that purpoſe, took poſſeſſion of the Caſtle to do Duty
there, according to their Antient Cuſtom; the Forces of the Allies
having the Town, and all the Out-works of the Caſtle. His
Majeſty went this Evening into the <hi>Caſtle, Cohorne,</hi> &amp;c. to view
the Works, the Breaches, and the Ruines, which were very
great; the Ground was all full of Bomb pits, and the ſtink of
the Dead Men and Horſes very noiſom. The Officers and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
had cut in the foot of the Walls within, and Counterſcarps,
little Cabbins, where they ſhelter'd themſelves from the fall of
our Bombs; ſome of which were lined with Deal-Boards, like
a kind of Wainſcot: The Marechal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> had his dwelling
in a <hi>Caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

104 Pieces of Canon, of different bigneſs, Ten Mortars, and
a great quantity of Powder, and other Ammunitions, but moſt
of the Canon was Diſmounted. His Electoral Highneſs went
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56660:90"/>
this ſame Evening in a Solemn manner to take poſſeſſion of the
Town, as Governour of the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> being received by
the Clergy, and Magiſtrates, and the <hi>Confrairies,</hi> (i. e.) Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of Tradeſmen under the Patronage of ſome Saint: The laſt
mounted upon Stilts about four Foot high, upon which they
walk't and danc't very dexterouſly, Beat Drums, Repreſented
Battles, and Diſplay'd their Banners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Elector went in
this order to the Cathedral, dedicated to St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> where the
Biſhop ſang <hi>Te Deum</hi> Pontifically, with Trumpets and Kettle-Drums.
A Stately Pyramid of Fire-works was prepared before
the <hi>Electors</hi> Lodgings for the Night, when all the Cannon round
the Place was thrice Diſcharged for its Deliverance from the
<hi>French;</hi> under which it had been (reckoning from the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation
<hi>June 20th.</hi> 1692, to the Capitulation <hi>Aug. 22. 1695.</hi>)
Three Years Two Moneths and Two Days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Thus this Important Place is fallen into our hands, which as
the <hi>French</hi> ſaid, <hi>could be Reſtored, but not Taken,</hi> which juſtly
deſerves the name of one of the ſtrongeſt Towns of <hi>Europe.</hi>
When <hi>Don John of Auſtria</hi> took it by Stratagem out of
the hands of the States of the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> who kept a
Garriſon in it by the Pacification of <hi>Ghent,</hi> he ſaid that he had
now the Key of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> in his Pocket, and that he was
Maſter of the Countrey: We may as well ſay now, That ſince
<hi>Namur</hi> opens the way between the <hi>Sambre</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi>
where the <hi>French</hi> have their weakeſt Frontier; that if we
maintain that ſuperiority of Forces we had the laſt Campagne,
(as it is our Intereſt, and the ſure way of bringing the War to a
ſpeedy and happy Concluſion) that it is the Key of Peace in our
hands: And if we conſider the vaſt ſtrength of the Place, both
by Nature and by Art, the great Garriſon in it, the Character
of a Marechal of <hi>France</hi> in general, and that of the Marechal
of <hi>Boufflers</hi> in particular, that defended it with the many High
and Conſiderable Officers under him: The great Armies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
on both ſides, either to Cover or Attempt the Relief of
this Siege, it may juſtly be rank'd among the moſt Famous
Sieges Regiſter'd in Hiſtory: But that which adds very much to
the Boldneſs of the Undertaking, and which ſhews the Viſible
Bleſſing of Almighty God upon it (which we ought alwayes
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56660:91"/>
thankfully to acknowledge) is, that at the ſame time we had a
weak Frontier left Naked, and expoſed to a Powerful Enemy:

therefore a Place not to be taken, but by the Arms of <hi>France,</hi>

Strength of <hi>Namur</hi> to what it was when the <hi>French</hi> took it,
and our Frontier to theirs; this muſt raiſe a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Siege of <hi>Namur</hi> 1692, and that of 1695. And that
which muſt Elevate the Glory of His Majeſty, the Great and
Happy Conductor of this Siege, above all that other Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
have done, is, That ſuch Monarchs have made Conqueſts
for themſelves, Conqueſts to oppreſs their Neighbours, and to
Raiſe a Mighty Empire upon their Ruine: But here His Majeſty
Expos'd Himſelf dayly to the greateſt Dangers to Conquer for
the good of <hi>Europe,</hi> to free it from Oppreſſion, and to Eſtabliſh
its Peace and Liberties upon a Laſting Foundation. I ſhall ſay
no more concerning this Famous Siege, but that the Forces of
all the Allies concern'd in it, have Acquitted themſelves like
Gallant Men, and by forcing this ſtrongeſt <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but particularly his Majeſties National Forces have done Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
they have Encounter'd the greateſt Dangers with ſo little
Fear and Concerne as ſurprized the Beſieged, and made them
believe our Men were fluſh't with Brandy before they went on;
as if Humane Nature, without ſome adventitious Supply was
not capable of ſo little Fear and Concern in ſuch Dangers.</p>

dayly Parties to take their Horſes, and to make Priſoners; in

the Ways were very bad and difficult to fetch Straw. The <hi>14th.</hi>

hands of a <hi>French</hi> Party that had crept between <hi>Halle</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels,</hi>
in their return to the Camp; Count <hi>Naſſaus</hi> two <hi>Aide de Camps</hi>
were made Priſoners juſt behind him, and carried to
<hi>Charleroy:</hi> Theſe were not the only Gentlemen that had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to fall into their hands: Their Little Sculking Parties
were very troubleſom between the Camp and <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> having
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56660:94"/>
the way open to get between our Camp and this Town by <hi>Halle;</hi>
if they came in great Parties they were more apt to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,

they met with Parties of Strangers to the Countrey, as
<hi>Engliſh, Germans,</hi> &amp;c. they would pretend themſelves to be
<hi>Walloons</hi> in the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Service. The <hi>17th.</hi> Captains
<hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Hemſly</hi> of Colonel <hi>Seymour</hi>'s Regiment, with the
Surgeon fell into the hands of one of theſe little Parties, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd

upon his left Wriſt, and they were all Three made Priſoners,
but the Party left Captain <hi>Hemſly</hi> wounded at <hi>Halle,</hi> upon the

Canton along the <hi>Dendre</hi> between <hi>Aloſt</hi> and <hi>Dendermond:</hi> And
the Weather having been very bad now, and moſt part of the
Summer, and Forrage ſcarce, and the Troops very much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigu'd,
and no fear of any Enterprize from the Enemies, this
made our Army ſeparate very early to go into Quarters. The

by the Regiments of Colonel <hi>Frederick Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Cinqvilles.</hi>
The <hi>20th.</hi> My Lord of <hi>Athlone,</hi> General of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe,

Ten Battallions of Foot, and Two of Dragoons Incamp'd at

in the Capitulations of <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> and <hi>Deinſe,</hi> being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Preſident of the High Court Marſhal to try them: For

of the <hi>French,</hi> they ſtill retain'd thoſe, whom by their ill
uſage and infraction of the <hi>Cartel</hi> and Capitulation, they had
forc'd to take on in their Service. 'Tis true, as 'tis ſaid that they
publiſht by Beat of Drum in ſeveral of their Frontier Garriſons,
that thoſe who had ſo been Liſted among them had liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
but they took care that none of the Parties concern'd
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56660:95"/>
ſhould have any benefit by it; however many of theſe forc'd
Soldiers have deſerted back to us this Summer, as <hi>Engliſh, Scots,</hi>
and <hi>Danes,</hi> and do Deſert dayly. The <hi>26th.</hi> the Elector left the
Army at St. <hi>Quintin Linneck</hi> to go to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the <hi>27th.</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Ploen,</hi> and the reſt of the Army here ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
into Winter Quarters. The ſame day His Majeſty came
from <hi>Loo</hi> to the <hi>Hague</hi> with Prince <hi>Vaudemont;</hi> and the <hi>28th</hi>
the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourgh;</hi> who had been retarded at <hi>Cleves</hi>
by ſome extraordinay Buſineſs, and ſo could not come to <hi>Loo.</hi>
The State of our Army in <hi>Flanders</hi> was reſolv'd upon here for
the next Campagne, and to Augment conſiderably our Forces,
whereby (notwithſtanding the great preparations of the Enemies,
and their new Levyes) we may ſtill be proportionably Superiour
to them in the Field, and purſue that Succeſs which it has pleaſed
God to give us the laſt Summer over our Enemies, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the great and neceſſary work of aſſerting our Liberties,
and the Liberties of all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> the only end of our Juſt and
Righteous Cauſe, and thereupon to ground a firm, laſting, and
happy Peace, which, (if we maintain that Power over our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
it has pleas'd God to give us the laſt Campagne) we need not
doubt of effecting very ſpeedily. One thing is certain, That if
the Allies Money holds out as long as that of the <hi>French</hi> Kings,
(as 'tis very reaſonable to think it ſhould) his Forces muſt fail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ours; for he has only <hi>France</hi> and his Conqueſts, with part
of <hi>Switzerland</hi> to recruit his Forces, and to make new Levyes,
but the Allies have all the reſt of Chriſtendom for an Inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Supply to make up their Armies. The King having ſpent
ſome days in Conferences with the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourgh</hi> and
States-General concerning this Important Work, Sailed the <hi>9th.</hi>
for <hi>England,</hi> where His Majeſty Arriv'd the <hi>10th</hi> at <hi>Margate,</hi>
and lay that Night at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and ſo His Majeſty came the
next day to <hi>Kenſington,</hi> being every where receiv'd by His good
and loving Subjects with all the demonſtration of the greateſt Joy
imaginable for the preſervation of His Sacred Perſon, amidſt all
the Dangers to which the King has expos'd Himſelf, and for the
great Succeſs of his Arms during the Campagne, which next
under God, is due to His Majeſty.</p>

Though our Armies were ſeparated into Winter-Quarters,<note place="margin">Octob.</note>
yet the Enemies ſtill continued to Canton up and down the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

<hi>Courtray.</hi> The Firſt of <hi>October</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Army (Quarter'd

they continued till about the <hi>18th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> that the Merechal
<hi>de Villeroy</hi> went to Court, and the Army into Quarters; but
upon their paſſage of the <hi>Lys</hi> to Canton along the River <hi>Mandel,</hi>
they made a Detachment of all their Forces deſign'd to quarter
near the Sea to form a Body near <hi>Furnes,</hi> which gave us ſome Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
for <hi>Newport;</hi> and upon this Motion, the Duke of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg</hi>
drew out 125 Men out of every Regiment of Foot of
our Forces, beſides the Regiments of <hi>Fairfax Daniſh</hi> Guards,
and <hi>Packmore</hi> intire, which made a Body of about Ten Thouſand
Men, and Incamp'd, with a ſmall Train of Artillery ſent from
<hi>Ghent</hi> for that purpoſe, upon the Sandhills near <hi>Newport,</hi> for
the ſafety of that place. But it does not appear that the Enemies
had any other deſign, than to make ſome new Works about
<hi>Furnes</hi> and <hi>Kenoque,</hi> which the Marechal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> came to
view, and the Fortifications of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> before his going to
Court. The Weather was extraordinary fair and favourable,
more than is uſual at this time of the Year, which I ſuppoſe kept
the Enemies out ſo much the longer. The <hi>22th.</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Wirtemberg</hi> with the Detachment under his Command returned
from the Neighbourhood of <hi>Newport</hi> back into Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
